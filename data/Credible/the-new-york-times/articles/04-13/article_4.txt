Trump</a>\u2019s presidential campaign, after a brief tenure during which Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination, Democrats\u2019 emails were hacked and the campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia came under scrutiny. Dogged by revelations about past financial dealings in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort retreated from public view.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"431\" data-total-count=\"837\">But behind the scenes, he was busy with other matters. Papers were recorded that same day creating a shell company controlled by Mr. Manafort that soon received $13 million in loans from two businesses with ties to Mr. Trump, including one that partners with a Ukrainian-born billionaire and another led by a Trump economic adviser. They were among $20 million in loans secured by properties belonging to Mr. Manafort and his wife.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"228\" data-total-count=\"1065\">The purpose of the loans is unstated in public records, although at least some of them appear to be part of an effort by Mr. Manafort to stave off a personal financial crisis stemming from failed investments with his son-in-law.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"204\" data-total-count=\"1269\">The transactions raise a number of questions, including whether Mr. Manafort\u2019s decision to turn to Trump-connected lenders was related to his role in the campaign, where he had agreed to serve for free.</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-1\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\n    <div class=\"supplemental first\" id=\"supplemental-1\">\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\n<div class=\"story-interrupter\" id=\"story-continues-1\">\n    <div id=\"FlexAd\" class=\"ad flex-ad nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-2\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    <div class=\"flex-ad-creative\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-2\">\n        <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"337\" data-total-count=\"1606\" id=\"story-continues-2\">They also shine a light on the rich real estate portfolio that Mr. Manafort acquired during and after the years he worked in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort, often using shell companies, invested millions of dollars in various properties, including apartments and condos in New York, homes in Florida and Virginia and luxury houses in Los Angeles.</p><div id=\"story-ad-1\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-3\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"357\" data-total-count=\"1963\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Mr. Manafort\u2019s ties to Ukraine and Russia have come under scrutiny as federal officials investigate Russian meddling in the American presidential election. Investigators are known to have examined aspects of his finances, including bank accounts he had in the secretive tax haven of <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/d43ef4166da6400ab45140978854bbbb\">Cyprus</a>; there is no indication his recent loans are part of the inquiry.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"601\" data-total-count=\"2564\">The source of the money for the real estate purchases is not clear, and Mr. Manafort never filed lobbying registrations for his work in Ukraine that would have disclosed his compensation. Such registrations are necessary for activities that involve influencing policy and public opinion in the United States, and some of Mr. Manafort\u2019s Ukraine work appeared to fall into that category. Anti-corruption officials in Ukraine say <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html\">$12.7 million</a> in \u201coff the books\u201d cash payments were earmarked for him in a handwritten ledger kept by the political party of the deposed strongman Viktor F.

The two payments in 2007 and 2009, totaling $1.2 million, were routed through shell companies in Belize to a bank account in Virginia belonging to Mr. Manafort\u2019s consulting firm.</p><figure id=\"media-100000005040860\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005040860 ratio-tall\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/13/us/13Manafort2/13Manafort2-master675.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/13/us/13Manafort2/13Manafort2-master675.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/13/us/13Manafort2/13Manafort2-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"A page from the handwritten ledger kept by the political party of the deposed strongman Viktor Yanukovych, released by anti-corruption officials in Ukraine.

The cable business was controlled by offshore shell companies that Ukrainian anti-corruption investigators said were used by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s inner circle to loot public assets.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"273\" data-total-count=\"7211\">And last summer, the Ukrainian investigators announced the discovery of the handwritten ledger, said to have been kept in the offices of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s political party before he was ousted in 2014, which showed the $12.7 million in payments designated for Mr. Manafort.</p><div class=\"newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter\" id=\"newsletter-promo\" data-newsletter-productCode=\"\" data-newsletter-productTitle=\"\">\n        <script type=\"application/json\" id=\"auto-newsletter-rules\">[{\"headline\":\"Morning Briefing\",\"summary\":\"Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.\",\"product-code\":\"NN\",\"product-title\":\"Morning Briefing\",\"sample-url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/morning-briefing?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=NN&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up\"},{\"headline\":\"Opinion Today\",\"summary\":\"Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\",\"product-code\":\"TY\",\"product-title\":\"Opinion Today\",\"sample-url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/opinion-today?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=TY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up\"},{\"headline\":\"The Upshot\",\"summary\":\"Get the best of The Upshot\\u2019s news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.\",\"product-code\":\"UP\",\"product-title\":\"The Upshot\",\"sample-url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/upshot?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=UP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up\"}]</script>\n        <h2 class=\"headline\"></h2>    <p class=\"summary\"></p>    <form name=\"regilite\" class=\"newsletter-form\" method=\"post\" autocomplete=\"off\">\n        <div class=\"control input-control\">\n            <div class=\"form-errors\">\n                <p class=\"error captcha-error hidden\">Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.</p>\n                <p class=\"error invalid-email-error hidden\">Invalid email address.

The thousands of messages span from 2012 to 2016 and include references to millions of dollars Mr. Manafort apparently transferred to his two daughters.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"344\" data-total-count=\"7941\">In one text written in 2015, Ms. Manafort, a lawyer, called her father\u2019s activities in Ukraine \u201clegally questionable,\u201d and in a separate exchange with her sister, Jessica, she worried that cash he gave them was tainted by the violent response to the uprising that ultimately led to the downfall of Mr. Manafort\u2019s client, Mr. Yanukovych.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-16\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-10\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"89\" data-total-count=\"8030\" id=\"story-continues-10\">\u201cDon\u2019t fool yourself,\u201d Ms. Manafort wrote. \u201cThat money we have is blood money.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"363\" data-total-count=\"8393\">In addition to the money he gave his daughters, Mr. Manafort also began acquiring a number of real estate assets during the years he worked in Ukraine, several of them costing millions of dollars and bought with cash. Among them is an apartment in Trump Tower in Manhattan, bought in 2006 for $3.7 million, and a Brooklyn brownstone bought in 2012 for $3 million.</p><div id=\"story-ad-3\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-11\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"317\" data-total-count=\"8710\" id=\"story-continues-11\">Being able to cite his Trump Tower address came in handy when he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/us/to-charm-trump-paul-manafort-sold-himself-as-an-affordable-outsider.html\">pitched his services</a> to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign early in 2016. By then, Mr. Manafort had been out of American politics for many years, but he expressed a desire to get back in the game and offered to work free, suggesting that he did not need the money.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-18\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-12\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"448\" data-total-count=\"9158\" id=\"story-continues-12\">Soon, however, he was embarking on a borrowing spree, using his many properties as collateral, including a summer home in the Hamptons valued at more than $11 million. The transactions began with the filing of papers that created the shell company, Summerbreeze L.L.C., on Aug. 19 as Mr. Manafort\u2019s resignation as campaign chairman was being announced. Shortly thereafter, Summerbreeze obtained the $3.5 million loan from the Spruce Capital unit.</p><figure id=\"news-tips-article-promo\" class=\"interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small\">\n    \n    \n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\n            <h2 class=\"interactive-headline\">\n            Got a confidential news tip?        </h2>\n                <p class=\"interactive-leadin\">\n            The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.        </p>\n        </figcaption>\n\n        <div class=\"interactive-graphic\">\n        <!--\n\n======================================================\n\nTHIS IS A GENERATED TEMPLATE FILE.

Calk</a>, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump at the time. The collateral for the loan included Mr. Manafort\u2019s Hamptons home and other assets.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-20\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-13\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"9806\" id=\"story-continues-13\">In addition to the loans taken out on the Hamptons house, Mr. Manafort has recently obtained mortgages on another property. Those loans, totaling $6.6 million, were obtained in January on a brownstone in Brooklyn and also came from Federal Savings Bank in Chicago.</p><h4 class=\"story-subheading story-content\" data-para-count=\"18\" data-total-count=\"9824\">Soured Investments</h4><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"515\" data-total-count=\"10339\">Mr. Manafort declined to explain the purpose of his loans. But a review of public records suggests at least some of them are connected to efforts to salvage investments he made with Jessica Manafort\u2019s husband, Jeffrey Yohai, whose real estate business filed for bankruptcy in December. Mr. Yohai faces a lawsuit by another co-investor who claims he exploited his connections to Mr. Manafort \u201cto meet numerous public figures and celebrities\u201d and solicit investments from them; Mr. Yohai denies the accusations.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"290\" data-total-count=\"10629\">In an affidavit filed in the bankruptcy case, Mr. Manafort said he had decided to \u201cassist with additional funding to protect my existing investments,\u201d totaling more than $4 million, in several luxury properties in California owned by limited liability companies controlled by Mr. Yohai.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"93\" data-total-count=\"10722\">Why Mr. Manafort opted to go to Spruce Capital and the Chicago bank for the loans is unclear.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"246\" data-total-count=\"10968\">For Federal Savings, Mr. Manafort\u2019s loans amount to about 5.4 percent of the bank\u2019s total assets. Mr. Calk did not respond to messages seeking comment, and a spokeswoman for Federal Savings said it would not discuss its customers\u2019 business.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-24\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-14\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"451\" data-total-count=\"11419\" id=\"story-continues-14\">At Spruce Capital, the loan secured by the Hamptons house appeared to be somewhat unusual. Of the 40 transactions listed under \u201crecent activities\u201d on the investment group\u2019s lending unit website, it was the only one outside of New York City and the sole loan involving a single-family house. Mr. Crane, the co-founder of Spruce Capital, had previously been involved in two Trump projects, including a Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower in Waikiki.</p><div id=\"story-ad-4\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-15\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"394\" data-total-count=\"11813\" id=\"story-continues-15\">Mr. Rovt, who has partnered with Mr. Crane\u2019s firm on several major real estate investments in New York and is an investor in its lending business, is active in the Ukrainian-American community. Last year, he took part in a small <a href=\"http://www.ukrweekly.com/uwwp/manor-college-hosts-forum-on-ukraines-stability/\">panel discussion</a> on Ukrainian relations at Manor College in Pennsylvania, where he shared the stage with Andrii V. Artemenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"399\" data-total-count=\"12212\">The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html\">reported in February</a> that Mr. Artemenko worked behind the scenes with Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, and Felix H. Sater, a former business associate of Mr. Trump\u2019s, to relay a proposed Ukrainian-Russian peace plan to the White House. Mr. Rovt, through his lawyer, said that he knew Mr. Artemenko, but that he was \u201cnot involved in any peace proposal.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"339\" data-total-count=\"12551\">As for his excessive last-minute donation to Mr. Trump in November, it stands out, given that Mr. Rovt had previously donated almost exclusively to Democrats during the election \u2014\u2013 including $2,700 to Hillary Clinton in February 2016. Mr. Rovt said the reason was simple: Friends had been encouraging him to support the Trump campaign.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"39\"

Mr. Manafort, often using shell companies, invested millions of dollars in various properties, including apartments and condos in New York, homes in Florida and Virginia and luxury houses in Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Manafort\u2019s ties to Ukraine and Russia have come under scrutiny as federal officials investigate Russian meddling in the American presidential election. Investigators are known to have examined aspects of his finances, including bank accounts he had in the secretive tax haven of Cyprus; there is no indication his recent loans are part of the inquiry.\n\nThe source of the money for the real estate purchases is not clear, and Mr. Manafort never filed lobbying registrations for his work in Ukraine that would have disclosed his compensation. Such registrations are necessary for activities that involve influencing policy and public opinion in the United States, and some of Mr. Manafort\u2019s Ukraine work appeared to fall into that category. Anti-corruption officials in Ukraine say $12.7 million in \u201coff the books\u201d cash payments were earmarked for him in a handwritten ledger kept by the political party of the deposed strongman Viktor F. Yanukovych.\n\nLast month, a Ukrainian lawmaker released documents that appeared to corroborate one of the ledger entries, and on Wednesday The Associated Press reported confirmation of another payment. The two payments in 2007 and 2009, totaling $1.2 million, were routed through shell companies in Belize to a bank account in Virginia belonging to Mr. Manafort\u2019s consulting firm.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Manafort has previously claimed the ledger is a fake. On Wednesday, he issued a statement that did not dispute the ledger entries, but suggested that any payments he received were legal because they were not made in cash.\n\n\u201cMr. Manafort has always denied that he ever received any cash payments for his work and has consistently maintained that he received all of his payments, for services rendered, through wire transfers conducted through the international banking system,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, a spokesman for Mr. Manafort said he had \u201creceived formal guidance recently from the authorities\u201d on the need to register, retroactively, for lobbying work in Ukraine, and was \u201ctaking appropriate steps in response.\u201d Mr. Manafort was advised last week that he should file the belated registration within 30 days to come into compliance with the law, according to a person with direct knowledge of conversations between Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers and the Justice Department.\n\nOne of Mr. Manafort\u2019s recent loans, previously unreported, was for $3.5 million in September from the private lending unit of Spruce Capital, a small New York investment firm that has a Ukrainian connection through the billionaire Alexander Rovt. An American citizen who made his fortune in the privatization of the fertilizer industry in post-Soviet Ukraine and has long done business in that part of the world, Mr. Rovt is a financial backer of Spruce, whose co-founder Joshua Crane has been a developer of Trump hotel projects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Crane did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Rovt, who donated $10,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign on Election Day \u2014 the campaign refunded most of it because it was over the legal maximum of $2,700 \u2014 said he had never met Mr. Manafort and was not involved in the loan to him. \u201cI did not recommend him or put the parties together,\u201d Mr. Rovt said in an email provided by his lawyer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Manafort declined to answer specific questions about any of his loans, other than to say that they \u201care personal and all reflect arm\u2019s-length transactions at or above market rates.\u201d He derided the interest that his finances had generated in the news media and among do-it-yourself researchers, some of whom have even set up a website that dissects his loans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is nothing out of the ordinary about them,\u201d Mr. Manafort said, \u201cand I am confident anyone who isn\u2019t afflicted with scandal fever will come to the same conclusion.\u201d\n\nA Trail of Scandal\n\nScandal has trailed Mr. Manafort since his earliest work as an international lobbyist and consultant in the 1980s, when he testified before Congress about influence peddling to win federal housing contracts and was linked to $10 million in cash that a confidant of the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos claimed was delivered to Mr. Manafort in a suitcase. In the 1990s, Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for clients such as the Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was cited in a human rights watchdog report, \u201cThe Torturers\u2019 Lobby,\u201d which examined Washington consultants who catered to brutal regimes.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Manafort went to work for Mr. Yanukovych and his Russian-backed Party of Regions in the mid-2000s, and during that time also entered into business deals with two oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska of Russia and Dmytro Firtash of Ukraine. Both deals, which were ultimately unsuccessful, involved the use of murky offshore companies and were tainted by allegations that cronies of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s schemed to funnel assets out of Ukraine.\n\nThe transaction with Mr. Deripaska, a billionaire industrialist close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, involved the attempted purchase of a Ukrainian cable telecommunications business using $18.9 million that Mr. Deripaska invested in a Cayman Islands partnership managed by Mr. Manafort. The cable business was controlled by offshore shell companies that Ukrainian anti-corruption investigators said were used by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s inner circle to loot public assets.\n\nAnd last summer, the Ukrainian investigators announced the discovery of the handwritten ledger, said to have been kept in the offices of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s political party before he was ousted in 2014, which showed the $12.7 million in payments designated for Mr. Manafort.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The thousands of messages span from 2012 to 2016 and include references to millions of dollars Mr. Manafort apparently transferred to his two daughters.\n\nIn one text written in 2015, Ms. Manafort, a lawyer, called her father\u2019s activities in Ukraine \u201clegally questionable,\u201d and in a separate exchange with her sister, Jessica, she worried that cash he gave them was tainted by the violent response to the uprising that ultimately led to the downfall of Mr. Manafort\u2019s client, Mr. Yanukovych.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fool yourself,\u201d Ms. Manafort wrote. \u201cThat money we have is blood money.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the money he gave his daughters, Mr. Manafort also began acquiring a number of real estate assets during the years he worked in Ukraine, several of them costing millions of dollars and bought with cash. Among them is an apartment in Trump Tower in Manhattan, bought in 2006 for $3.7 million, and a Brooklyn brownstone bought in 2012 for $3 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeing able to cite his Trump Tower address came in handy when he pitched his services to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign early in 2016. By then, Mr. Manafort had been out of American politics for many years, but he expressed a desire to get back in the game and offered to work free, suggesting that he did not need the money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSoon, however, he was embarking on a borrowing spree, using his many properties as collateral, including a summer home in the Hamptons valued at more than $11 million. The transactions began with the filing of papers that created the shell company, Summerbreeze L.L.C., on Aug. 19 as Mr. Manafort\u2019s resignation as campaign chairman was being announced. Shortly thereafter, Summerbreeze obtained the $3.5 million loan from the Spruce Capital unit.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nIn November, after Mr. Trump won the presidential election, Summerbreeze received a second loan, for $9.5 million, from Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, which focuses on affordable mortgages for military veterans and is headed by Stephen M. Calk, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump at the time. The collateral for the loan included Mr. Manafort\u2019s Hamptons home and other assets.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to the loans taken out on the Hamptons house, Mr. Manafort has recently obtained mortgages on another property. Those loans, totaling $6.6 million, were obtained in January on a brownstone in Brooklyn and also came from Federal Savings Bank in Chicago.\n\nSoured Investments\n\nMr. Manafort declined to explain the purpose of his loans. But a review of public records suggests at least some of them are connected to efforts to salvage investments he made with Jessica Manafort\u2019s husband, Jeffrey Yohai, whose real estate business filed for bankruptcy in December. Mr. Yohai faces a lawsuit by another co-investor who claims he exploited his connections to Mr. Manafort \u201cto meet numerous public figures and celebrities\u201d and solicit investments from them; Mr. Yohai denies the accusations.\n\nIn an affidavit filed in the bankruptcy case, Mr. Manafort said he had decided to \u201cassist with additional funding to protect my existing investments,\u201d totaling more than $4 million, in several luxury properties in California owned by limited liability companies controlled by Mr. Yohai.\n\nWhy Mr. Manafort opted to go to Spruce Capital and the Chicago bank for the loans is unclear.\n\nFor Federal Savings, Mr. Manafort\u2019s loans amount to about 5.4 percent of the bank\u2019s total assets. Mr. Calk did not respond to messages seeking comment, and a spokeswoman for Federal Savings said it would not discuss its customers\u2019 business.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt Spruce Capital, the loan secured by the Hamptons house appeared to be somewhat unusual. Of the 40 transactions listed under \u201crecent activities\u201d on the investment group\u2019s lending unit website, it was the only one outside of New York City and the sole loan involving a single-family house. Mr. Crane, the co-founder of Spruce Capital, had previously been involved in two Trump projects, including a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Waikiki.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Rovt, who has partnered with Mr. Crane\u2019s firm on several major real estate investments in New York and is an investor in its lending business, is active in the Ukrainian-American community. Last year, he took part in a small panel discussion on Ukrainian relations at Manor College in Pennsylvania, where he shared the stage with Andrii V. Artemenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament.\n\nThe New York Times reported in February that Mr. Artemenko worked behind the scenes with Michael D.
