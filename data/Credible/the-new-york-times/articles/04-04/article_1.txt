But in March, facing crises on multiple fronts, top officials convened a call for reporters to insist that Uber was changing its culture and would no longer tolerate &#x201C;brilliant jerks.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">1</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Notably, the company also announced that it would fix its troubled relationship with drivers, who have complained for years about falling pay and arbitrary treatment.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">2</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve underinvested in the driver experience,&#x201D; a <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/press-call/\">senior official</a> said. &#x201C;We are now re-examining everything we do in order to rebuild that love.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">3</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">And yet even as Uber talks up its determination to treat drivers more humanely, it is engaged in an extraordinary behind-the-scenes experiment in behavioral science to manipulate them in the service of its corporate growth &#x2014; an effort whose dimensions became evident in interviews with several dozen current and former Uber officials, drivers and social scientists, as well as a review of behavioral research.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">4</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Uber&#x2019;s innovations reflect the changing ways companies are managing workers amid the rise of the freelance-based &#x201C;gig economy.&#x201D; Its drivers are officially independent business owners rather than traditional employees with set schedules. This allows Uber to minimize labor costs, but means it cannot compel drivers to show up at a specific place and time. And this lack of control can wreak havoc on a service whose goal is to seamlessly transport passengers whenever and wherever they want.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">5</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Uber helps solve this fundamental problem by using psychological inducements and other techniques unearthed by social science to influence when, where and how long drivers work. It&#x2019;s a quest for a perfectly efficient system: a balance between rider demand and driver supply at the lowest cost to passengers and the company.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">6</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Employing hundreds of social scientists and data scientists, Uber has experimented with video game techniques, graphics and noncash rewards of little value that can prod drivers into working longer and harder &#x2014; and sometimes at hours and locations that are less lucrative for them.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n<div class=\"g-game \" id=\"g-box-id-idle-time\">\n\n     <h2 class=\"balance-text\">Faster pickup times mean more idle drivers.</h2>\n    <div class=\"g-caption\">Change the number of drivers in this ride-share simulation.

It has even concocted an algorithm similar to a Netflix feature that automatically loads the next program, which many experts believe encourages binge-watching. In Uber&#x2019;s case, this means sending drivers their next fare opportunity before their current ride is even over.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">8</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">And most of this happens without giving off a whiff of coercion.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">9</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">&#x201C;We show drivers areas of high demand or incentivize them to drive more,&#x201D; said Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman. &#x201C;But any driver can stop work literally at the tap of a button &#x2014; the decision whether or not to drive is 100 percent theirs.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">10</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Uber&#x2019;s recent emphasis on drivers is no accident. As problems have mounted at the company, from an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/business/uber-sexual-harassment-investigation.html\">allegation of sexual harassment</a> in its offices to revelations that it created a tool to deliberately <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html\">evade regulatory scrutiny</a>, Uber has made softening its posture toward drivers a litmus test of its ability to become a better corporate citizen. The tension was particularly evident after its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, engaged in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/technology/uber-chief-apologizes-after-video-shows-him-arguing-with-driver.html\">heated argument with a driver</a> that was captured in a viral video obtained by Bloomberg and that prompted an abject apology.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">11</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">But an examination by The New York Times found that Uber is continuing apace in its struggle to wield the upper hand with drivers. And as so-called platform-mediated work like driving for Uber increasingly becomes the way people make a living, the company&#x2019;s example illustrates that pulling psychological levers may eventually become the reigning approach to managing the American worker.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">12</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">While Uber is arguably the biggest and most sophisticated player in inducing workers to serve its corporate goals, other &#x201C;gig economy&#x201D; platforms are also involved. Uber&#x2019;s main competitor, Lyft, and popular delivery services <a href=\"https://blog.postmates.com/making-postmates-even-more-efficient-690aacb7fad6#.w539rcbtb\">like Postmates</a> rely on <a href=\"https://www.coworker.org/petitions/have-a-i-m-done-after-this-delivery-button-so-you-don-t-have-to-reject-jobs\">similar approaches</a>. So do <a href=\"http://data-people.cs.illinois.edu/papers/crowd-book.pdf\">companies</a> and individuals posting assignments on crowdsourcing sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk, where hundreds of thousands of workers earn piece-rate wages by completing discrete tasks.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">13</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Of course, many companies try to nudge consumers into buying their products and services using psychological tricks. But extending these efforts to the work force is potentially transformative.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">14</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Though employers have long borrowed insights from social science to get more out of their workers &#x2014; tech companies like Google have <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790\">calculated</a> that employees interact more with unfamiliar colleagues when they can graze together at snack bars &#x2014; they are constrained in doing so. A large body of law and custom in the United States holds that because employers have far more power over their employees than businesses do over their customers, they must provide them with far greater protections &#x2014; not least, a minimum wage and overtime pay.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">15</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Uber exists in a kind of legal and ethical purgatory, however. Because its drivers are independent contractors, they lack most of the protections associated with employment. By mastering their workers&#x2019; mental circuitry, Uber and the like may be taking the economy back toward a pre-New Deal era when businesses had enormous power over workers and few checks on their ability to exploit it.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">16</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">&#x201C;We&#x2019;re talking about this kind of manipulation that literally affects people&#x2019;s income,&#x201D; said Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who with Alex Rosenblat has <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2929643\">written a paper</a> on the way companies use data and algorithms to exploit psychological weaknesses. Uber officials, he said, are &#x201C;using what they know about drivers, their control over the interface and the terms of transaction to channel the behavior of the driver in the direction they want it to go.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">17</span>-->\n\n  <h4 data-tag=\"subhead\" class=\"header\">An Empathy Question</h4>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">18</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">In early 2016, a group of roughly 100 Uber employees responsible for signing up drivers and getting them to drive more voted to change its name &#x2014; from &#x201C;supply growth&#x201D; to &#x201C;driver growth.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    <div class=\"g-ad-wrapper\"></div>\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">19</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">The vote was not unprompted.

Drivers, who typically keep what&#x2019;s left of their <a href=\"https://help.uber.com/h/ee8c8fb6-9a01-4e16-ab20-3ce7ae6bb1c1\">gross fare</a> after Uber takes a roughly 25 percent commission, prefer some scarcity in their ranks to keep them busier and push up earnings.

In its messages to drivers, it included a graphic of an engine gauge with a needle that came tantalizingly close to, but was still short of, a dollar sign.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">58</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">And the ludic loop is far from the only video game feature that Uber has adapted as a way of keeping drivers on the road.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    <div class=\"g-ad-wrapper\"></div>\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">59</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">At any moment, the app shows drivers how many trips they have taken in the current week, how much money they have made, how much time they have spent logged on and what their overall rating from passengers is. All of these metrics can stimulate the competitive juices that drive compulsive game-playing.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">60</span>-->\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  <figure class=\"media-outerContainer media photo small\">\n  <div class=\"media-innerContainer\">\n    <div class=\"media lazy-media image\" >\n      <img class=\"g-lazy\"\n      src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAO3t7QAAACH/C1hNUCBEYXRhWE1QAT8AIfkEBQAAAAAsAAAAAAEAAQAAAgJEAQA7\"\n      data-pattern='https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/27/business/00UBERDRIVER5/00UBERDRIVER5-{{size}}.jpg'\n      data-widths='[{\"slug\":\"master180\",\"size\":180},{\"slug\":\"blog225\",\"size\":225},{\"slug\":\"slide\",\"size\":282},{\"slug\":\"popup\",\"size\":282},{\"slug\":\"tmagSF\",\"size\":362},{\"slug\":\"blog427\",\"size\":427},{\"slug\":\"blog480\",\"size\":480},{\"slug\":\"master495\",\"size\":495},{\"slug\":\"blog533\",\"size\":533},{\"slug\":\"jumbo\",\"size\":576},{\"slug\":\"tmagArticle\",\"size\":592},{\"slug\":\"articleLarge\",\"size\":600},{\"slug\":\"master675\",\"size\":675},{\"slug\":\"master1050\",\"size\":1050},{\"slug\":\"superJumbo\",\"size\":1152}]'\n      data-height-multiplier='1.7777777777777777' />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"caption\">\n      <div class=\"caption-wrapper\">\n        <span class=\"caption-text\">One of the messages Uber has sent its drivers to encourage them to stay on the road.</span>\n        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\"></span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">61</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">&#x201C;The whole thing is like a video game,&#x201D; said Eli Solomon, a veteran Uber and Lyft driver in the Chicago area, who said he sometimes had to fight the urge to work more after glancing at his data.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">62</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes the so-called gamification is quite literal. Like players on video game platforms such as Xbox, PlayStation and Pogo, Uber drivers can earn badges for achievements like Above and Beyond (denoted on the app by a cartoon of a rocket blasting off), Excellent Service (marked by a picture of a sparkling diamond) and Entertaining Drive (a pair of Groucho Marx glasses with nose and eyebrows).</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">63</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Of course, managers have been borrowing from the logic of games for generations, as when they set up contests and competition among workers. More overt forms of gamification have proliferated during the past decade. For example, Microsoft has used the approach to entice workers to perform the otherwise sleep-inducing task of software debugging.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">64</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">But Uber can go much further. Because it mediates its drivers&#x2019; entire work experience through an app, there are few limits to the elements it can gamify. Uber collects staggering amounts of data that allow it to discard game features that do not work and refine those that do. And because its workers are contractors, the gamification strategies are not hemmed in by employment law.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">65</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Kevin Werbach, a business professor who has written extensively on the subject, said that while gamification could be a force for good in the gig economy &#x2014; for example, by creating bonds among workers who do not share a physical space &#x2014; there was a danger of abuse. &#x201C;If what you&#x2019;re doing is basically saying, &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve found a cheap way to get you to do work without paying you for it, we&#x2019;ll pay you in badges that don&#x2019;t cost anything,&#x2019; that&#x2019;s a manipulative way to go about it,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">66</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">For some drivers, that is precisely the effect. Scott Weber said he drove full time most weeks last year, picking up passengers in the Tampa area for both Uber and Lyft, yet made less than $20,000 before expenses like gas and maintenance. &#x201C;I was a business that had a loss,&#x201D; said Mr. Weber, who is looking for another job. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m using payday loans.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">67</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Still, when asked about the badges he earns while driving for Uber, Mr. Weber practically gushed. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got currently 12 excellent-service and nine great-conversation badges,&#x201D; he said in an interview in early March. &#x201C;It tells me where I&#x2019;m at.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">68</span>-->\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  <figure class=\"media-outerContainer media photo large\">\n  <div class=\"media-innerContainer\">\n    <div class=\"media lazy-media image\" >\n      <img class=\"g-lazy\"\n      src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAO3t7QAAACH/C1hNUCBEYXRhWE1QAT8AIfkEBQAAAAAsAAAAAAEAAQAAAgJEAQA7\"\n      data-pattern='https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/31/business/00UBERDRIVER6-sub/00UBERDRIVER6-sub-{{size}}.jpg'\n      data-widths='[{\"slug\":\"master180\",\"size\":180},{\"slug\":\"blog225\",\"size\":225},{\"slug\":\"tmagSF\",\"size\":362},{\"slug\":\"blog427\",\"size\":427},{\"slug\":\"blog480\",\"size\":480},{\"slug\":\"master495\",\"size\":495},{\"slug\":\"blog533\",\"size\":533},{\"slug\":\"tmagArticle\",\"size\":592},{\"slug\":\"articleLarge\",\"size\":600},{\"slug\":\"slide\",\"size\":600},{\"slug\":\"popup\",\"size\":650},{\"slug\":\"master675\",\"size\":675},{\"slug\":\"jumbo\",\"size\":1024},{\"slug\":\"master1050\",\"size\":1050},{\"slug\":\"superJumbo\",\"size\":2048}]'\n      data-height-multiplier='0.6666666666666666' />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"caption\">\n      <div class=\"caption-wrapper\">\n        <span class=\"caption-text\">Scott Weber, a driver for both Uber and Lyft in the Tampa area, said he drove full time most weeks last year but struggled to turn a profit.</span>\n        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">Edward Linsmier for The New York Times</span>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</figure>\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">69</span>-->\n\n  <h4 data-tag=\"subhead\" class=\"header\">&#x2018;Constantly Busy&#x2019;</h4>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">70</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">When asked whether Uber&#x2019;s product managers and data scientists were akin to developers at a social gaming company like Zynga, Jonathan Hall, Uber&#x2019;s head of economic and policy research, accepted the analogy but rejected the implication.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">71</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">&#x201C;I think there&#x2019;s something to that, but ultimately Zynga should worry mostly about how fun its games are rather than trying to get you to play a little bit more by some trick,&#x201D; he said. He argued that exploiting people&#x2019;s psychological tics was unlikely to have more than a marginal effect on how long they played Zynga&#x2019;s games or drove for Uber.

But it can also work against their interests by increasing the number of drivers on the road and defusing fare surges. And whether they enjoy it is separate from the question of agency &#x2014; whether they have it, or whether the company does.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">82</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Uber officials say the feature initially produced so many rides at times that drivers began to experience a chronic Netflix ailment &#x2014; the inability to stop for a bathroom break. Amid the uproar, Uber introduced a pause button.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">83</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">&#x201C;Drivers were saying: &#x2018;I can never go offline. I&#x2019;m on just continuous trips. This is a problem.&#x2019; So we redesigned it,&#x201D; said Maya Choksi, a senior Uber official in charge of building products that help drivers. &#x201C;In the middle of the trip, you can say, &#x2018;Stop giving me requests.&#x2019; So you can have more control over when you want to stop driving.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">84</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">It is true that drivers can pause the services&#x2019; automatic queuing feature if they need to refill their tanks, or empty them, as the case may be. Yet once they log back in and accept their next ride, the feature kicks in again. To disable it, they would have to pause it every time they picked up a new passenger. By contrast, even Netflix allows users to permanently <a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/2102\">turn off</a> its automatic queuing feature, known as Post-Play.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">85</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">This pre-emptive hard-wiring can have a huge influence on behavior, said David Laibson, the chairman of the economics department at Harvard and a leading behavioral economist. Perhaps most notably, as Ms. Rosenblat and Luke Stark observed in an <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2686227\">influential paper</a> on these practices, Uber&#x2019;s app does not let drivers see where a passenger is going before accepting the ride, making it hard to judge how profitable a trip will be.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">86</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes all that is necessary is the mere setting of a so-called default. Because humans tend to be governed by inertia, automatically enrolling them in retirement savings plans and then allowing them to opt out results in far higher participation than letting them opt in. Making Post-Play the default can have the same effect.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">87</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">&#x201C;If done right, these things can be socially beneficial,&#x201D; Mr. Laibson said. &#x201C;But you can think of all sorts of choice architecture that are quite contrary to human well-being.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">88</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Even Mr. Hall, the Uber research director who downplayed the importance of behavioral economics to the company, did make at least one concession. &#x201C;The optimal default we set is that we want you to do as much work as there is to do,&#x201D; he said of the company&#x2019;s app. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not required to by any means.

Go home.&#x2019;&#x201D; Uber has already rolled out <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/safety-on-the-road-july-2016/\">efforts</a> in this vein in numerous cities.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">95</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">That moment of maturity does not appear to have arrived yet, however. Consider a prompt that Uber rolled out this year, inviting drivers to press a large box if they want the app to navigate them to an area where they have a &#x201C;higher chance&#x201D; of finding passengers. The accompanying graphic resembles the one that indicates that an area&#x2019;s fares are &#x201C;surging,&#x201D; except in this case fares are not necessarily higher.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">96</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Some drivers believe that the intent is to trick them into driving where Uber wants them to go, rather than where driving would be most profitable, by implying that they will find a surge there. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re trying to move people where they want them,&#x201D; said Mr. Weber, the Tampa-area driver. &#x201C;But you get there and it&#x2019;s nothing. It happens all the time.&#x201D; Mr. Weber noted that the design of the graphic makes the prompt much easier to accept than decline, which requires pressing a small rectangle in the top left corner.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">97</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Uber said that the feature was an experiment intended primarily to help new drivers who frequently say they do not know where to find passengers, and that it could be changed if drivers were dissatisfied.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">98</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Individual features aside, the broader question of how much Uber seeks to influence drivers through behavioral science may come down to how much its business model requires it.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    <div class=\"g-ad-wrapper\"></div>\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">99</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">While the company has made no secret of its investment in self-driving cars, it could be a decade or more before they completely replace human drivers. In the meantime, as long as Uber continues to set growth and passenger volume as critical goals, it will have an incentive to make wringing more hours out of drivers a higher priority than the drivers&#x2019; bottom line whenever it faces a close call between the two.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">100</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">It will also have an incentive to obtain these hours as cheaply as possible. And there is simply no cheaper way than hiring contractors and nudging them to drive when and where they are needed. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/business/a-middle-ground-between-contract-worker-and-employee.html?_r=1\">Industry insiders estimate</a> that relying on independent contractors rather than employees can lower direct costs by roughly 25 percent.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">101</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Moreover, the contractor model itself provides a strong impetus for companies like Uber to grow. Many companies in the gig economy simply do not have enough workers, or rich enough data about their workers&#x2019; behavior, to navigate busy periods using nudges and the like. To avoid chronic understaffing, they have switched to an employee model that allows them to compel workers to log in when the companies most need them.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">102</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">Once companies achieve a certain scale, on the other hand, they enter a virtuous cycle: The risk of understaffing drops with a big enough pool of workers, and the cost savings of using contractors begins to outweigh the inefficiencies. This in turn frees up money to enter new markets and acquire new customers, which makes the contractor model still more efficient, and throws off still more savings.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">103</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">It is, as a result, not too hard to imagine a future in which massive digital platforms like Uber have an appetite for tens of millions of workers &#x2014; not only for ferrying people, but also for delivering food and retail goods. Nor is it hard to imagine workers&#x2019; obliging them, perhaps because their skills do not match the needs of more traditional employers, or because they need to supplement their wages.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">104</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">In such an economy, experts say, using big data and algorithms to manage workers will not simply be a niche phenomenon. It may become one of the most common ways of managing the American labor force.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">105</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">&#x201C;You have all these players entering into this space, and the assumption is they&#x2019;ll do it through vast armies of underemployed people looking for extra hours, and we can control every nuance about what they do but not have to pay them,&#x201D; said David Weil, the top wage-and-hour official under President Barack Obama.</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  <!-- Insert simulation -->\n  \n\n  <!--<span class=\"g-graf\">106</span>-->\n\n  \n  <p class=\"paragraph\">When you stop to consider the enormous cost advantages, Mr. Weil said, &#x201C;it says to me this is an area that will grow fast.&#x201D;</p>\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  <div class=\"g-article-credits\">\n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"g-ad-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  define('_nytg/2017-03-07-uber/assets', function() { return 'https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/03/07/uber/056e5a9659be0480cf246a10ea5f64a55ada7263/'; });\n  define('_nytg/2017-03-07-uber/big-assets', function() { return 'https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/03/07/uber/assets/'; });\n\n  require(['foundation/main'], function() {\n    require(['https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/03/07/uber/056e5a9659be0480cf246a10ea5f64a55ada7263/build.js']); // generated from src/script.js\n  });\n</script>\n<!-- Pipeline: 2017-03-07-uber | April 4, 2017, 03:57PM | 056e5a9659be0480cf246a10ea5f64a55ada7263 -->\n    </div>\n\n        <footer class=\"story-footer\">\n\n        \n                <div class=\"story-info interactive-source\">\n            <p>Additional production by LARRY BUCHANAN and ASHWIN SESHAGIRI/THE NEW YORK TIMES.

But in March, facing crises on multiple fronts, top officials convened a call for reporters to insist that Uber was changing its culture and would no longer tolerate \u201cbrilliant jerks.\u201d\n\nNotably, the company also announced that it would fix its troubled relationship with drivers, who have complained for years about falling pay and arbitrary treatment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve underinvested in the driver experience,\u201d a senior official said. \u201cWe are now re-examining everything we do in order to rebuild that love.\u201d\n\nAnd yet even as Uber talks up its determination to treat drivers more humanely, it is engaged in an extraordinary behind-the-scenes experiment in behavioral science to manipulate them in the service of its corporate growth \u2014 an effort whose dimensions became evident in interviews with several dozen current and former Uber officials, drivers and social scientists, as well as a review of behavioral research.\n\nUber\u2019s innovations reflect the changing ways companies are managing workers amid the rise of the freelance-based \u201cgig economy.\u201d Its drivers are officially independent business owners rather than traditional employees with set schedules. This allows Uber to minimize labor costs, but means it cannot compel drivers to show up at a specific place and time. And this lack of control can wreak havoc on a service whose goal is to seamlessly transport passengers whenever and wherever they want.\n\nUber helps solve this fundamental problem by using psychological inducements and other techniques unearthed by social science to influence when, where and how long drivers work. It\u2019s a quest for a perfectly efficient system: a balance between rider demand and driver supply at the lowest cost to passengers and the company.\n\nEmploying hundreds of social scientists and data scientists, Uber has experimented with video game techniques, graphics and noncash rewards of little value that can prod drivers into working longer and harder \u2014 and sometimes at hours and locations that are less lucrative for them.\n\nFaster pickup times mean more idle drivers. Change the number of drivers in this ride-share simulation. Faster pickup times for riders require a greater percentage of drivers to be idling unpaid.\n\nTo keep drivers on the road, the company has exploited some people\u2019s tendency to set earnings goals \u2014 alerting them that they are ever so close to hitting a precious target when they try to log off. It has even concocted an algorithm similar to a Netflix feature that automatically loads the next program, which many experts believe encourages binge-watching. In Uber\u2019s case, this means sending drivers their next fare opportunity before their current ride is even over.\n\nAnd most of this happens without giving off a whiff of coercion.\n\n\u201cWe show drivers areas of high demand or incentivize them to drive more,\u201d said Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman. \u201cBut any driver can stop work literally at the tap of a button \u2014 the decision whether or not to drive is 100 percent theirs.\u201d\n\nUber\u2019s recent emphasis on drivers is no accident. As problems have mounted at the company, from an allegation of sexual harassment in its offices to revelations that it created a tool to deliberately evade regulatory scrutiny, Uber has made softening its posture toward drivers a litmus test of its ability to become a better corporate citizen. The tension was particularly evident after its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, engaged in a heated argument with a driver that was captured in a viral video obtained by Bloomberg and that prompted an abject apology.\n\nBut an examination by The New York Times found that Uber is continuing apace in its struggle to wield the upper hand with drivers. And as so-called platform-mediated work like driving for Uber increasingly becomes the way people make a living, the company\u2019s example illustrates that pulling psychological levers may eventually become the reigning approach to managing the American worker.\n\nWhile Uber is arguably the biggest and most sophisticated player in inducing workers to serve its corporate goals, other \u201cgig economy\u201d platforms are also involved. Uber\u2019s main competitor, Lyft, and popular delivery services like Postmates rely on similar approaches. So do companies and individuals posting assignments on crowdsourcing sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk, where hundreds of thousands of workers earn piece-rate wages by completing discrete tasks.\n\nOf course, many companies try to nudge consumers into buying their products and services using psychological tricks. But extending these efforts to the work force is potentially transformative.\n\nThough employers have long borrowed insights from social science to get more out of their workers \u2014 tech companies like Google have calculated that employees interact more with unfamiliar colleagues when they can graze together at snack bars \u2014 they are constrained in doing so. A large body of law and custom in the United States holds that because employers have far more power over their employees than businesses do over their customers, they must provide them with far greater protections \u2014 not least, a minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\nUber exists in a kind of legal and ethical purgatory, however. Because its drivers are independent contractors, they lack most of the protections associated with employment. By mastering their workers\u2019 mental circuitry, Uber and the like may be taking the economy back toward a pre-New Deal era when businesses had enormous power over workers and few checks on their ability to exploit it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about this kind of manipulation that literally affects people\u2019s income,\u201d said Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington who with Alex Rosenblat has written a paper on the way companies use data and algorithms to exploit psychological weaknesses. Uber officials, he said, are \u201cusing what they know about drivers, their control over the interface and the terms of transaction to channel the behavior of the driver in the direction they want it to go.\u201d\n\nAn Empathy Question\n\nIn early 2016, a group of roughly 100 Uber employees responsible for signing up drivers and getting them to drive more voted to change its name \u2014 from \u201csupply growth\u201d to \u201cdriver growth.\u201d\n\nThe vote was not unprompted. For much of the previous year, Uber executives had agonized over how to lower the rate at which drivers were deserting the platform.\n\nAlongside Uber\u2019s already daunting targets for expanding its pool of drivers to meet mounting demand, the high turnover threatened to cap the company\u2019s growth and throw it into crisis.\n\nUber conducted interviews and focus groups while executives peppered employees with questions like, \u201cWhat are we doing to have more empathy for the driver side of the equation?\u201d\n\nUnderlying the tension was the fact that Uber\u2019s interests and those of drivers are at odds on some level. Drivers, who typically keep what\u2019s left of their gross fare after Uber takes a roughly 25 percent commission, prefer some scarcity in their ranks to keep them busier and push up earnings. For its part, Uber is desperate to avoid shortages, seeking instead to serve every customer quickly, ideally in five minutes or less.\n\nThis is particularly true of shortages so pronounced as to create a \u201csurge\u201d \u2014 that is, a higher fare than normal. While surges do mitigate shortages, they do so in part by repelling passengers, something directly at odds with Uber\u2019s long-term goal of dominating the industry. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s better not to surge,\u201d said Daniel Graf, Uber\u2019s vice president of product. \u201cIf we don\u2019t surge, we can produce more rides.\u201d\n\nAs a result, much of Uber\u2019s communication with drivers over the years has aimed at combating shortages by advising drivers to move to areas where they exist, or where they might arise. Uber encouraged its local managers to experiment with ways of achieving this.\n\n\u201cIt was all day long, every day \u2014 texts, emails, pop-ups: \u2018Hey, the morning rush has started. Get to this area, that\u2019s where demand is biggest,\u2019\u201d said Ed Frantzen, a veteran Uber driver in the Chicago area. \u201cIt was always, constantly, trying to get you into a certain direction.\u201d\n\nSome local managers who were men went so far as to adopt a female persona for texting drivers, having found that the uptake was higher when they did.\n\n\u201c\u2018Laura\u2019 would tell drivers: \u2018Hey, the concert\u2019s about to let out. You should head over there,\u2019\u201d said John P. Parker, a manager in Uber\u2019s Dallas office in 2014 and 2015, referring to one of the personas. \u201cWe have an overwhelmingly male driver population.\u201d\n\nUber acknowledged that it had experimented with female personas to increase engagement with drivers.\n\nThe friction over meeting demand was compounded by complaints about arrangements like aggressive car leases that required many drivers to work upward of 50 or 60 hours each week to eke out a profit. Uber officials began to worry that a driver backlash was putting them at a strategic disadvantage in their competition with Lyft, which had cultivated a reputation for being more driver-friendly.\n\nUber had long been a reflection of Mr. Kalanick, its charismatic and hard-charging chief, who has often involved himself in corporate minutiae. According to an article in The Information, Mr. Kalanick had complained to subordinates that he was not informed sooner about a glitch with the company\u2019s push notifications and had personally weighed in on the time at which employees could receive free dinner.\n\nNow Uber began a process of, in effect, becoming a little less like Mr. Kalanick, and a little more like Lyft.\n\nIt rethought a lease program, softened the hectoring tone of its messages and limited their volume. At times it became positively cheery.\n\nDuring roughly the same period, Uber was increasingly concerned that many new drivers were leaving the platform before completing the 25 rides that would earn them a signing bonus. To stem that tide, Uber officials in some cities began experimenting with simple encouragement: You\u2019re almost halfway there, congratulations!\n\nWhile the experiment seemed warm and innocuous, it had in fact been exquisitely calibrated. The company\u2019s data scientists had previously discovered that once drivers reached the 25-ride threshold, their rate of attrition fell sharply.\n\nAnd psychologists and video game designers have long known that encouragement toward a concrete goal can motivate people to complete a task.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting you to internalize the company\u2019s goals,\u201d said Chelsea Howe, a prominent video game designer who has spoken out against coercive psychological techniques deployed in games. \u201cInternalized motivation is the most powerful kind.\u201d\n\nMr. Amodeo, the Uber spokesman, defended the practice. \u201cWe try to make the early experience as good as possible, but also as realistic as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to decide for themselves if driving is right for them.\u201d\n\nThat making drivers feel good could be compatible with treating them as lab subjects was no surprise. None other than Lyft itself had shown as much several years earlier.\n\nIn 2013, the company hired a consulting firm to figure out how to encourage more driving during the platform\u2019s busiest hours.\n\nAt the time, Lyft drivers could voluntarily sign up in advance for shifts. The consultants devised an experiment in which the company showed one group of inexperienced drivers how much more they would make by moving from a slow period like Tuesday morning to a busy time like Friday night \u2014 about $15 more per hour.\n\nFor another group, Lyft reversed the calculation, displaying how much drivers were losing by sticking with Tuesdays.\n\nThe latter had a more significant effect on increasing the hours drivers scheduled during busy periods.\n\nKristen Berman, one of the consultants, explained at a presentation in 2014 that the experiment had roots in the field of behavioral economics, which studies the cognitive hang-ups that frequently skew decision-making. Its central finding derived from a concept known as loss aversion, which holds that people \u201cdislike losing more than they like gaining,\u201d Ms. Berman said.\n\nWhat motivates you more: seeing gains or fearing losses?\n\nStill, Ms. Berman disclosed in an interview, Lyft eventually decided against using the loss-aversion approach, suggesting that the company has drawn brighter lines when it comes to potential manipulation.\n\nAlmost There\n\nAs he tried to log off at 7:13 a.m. on New Year\u2019s Day last year, Josh Streeter, then an Uber driver in the Tampa, Fla., area, received a message on the company\u2019s driver app with the headline \u201cMake it to $330.\u201d The text then explained: \u201cYou\u2019re $10 away from making $330 in net earnings. Are you sure you want to go offline?\u201d Below were two prompts: \u201cGo offline\u201d and \u201cKeep driving.\u201d The latter was already highlighted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got screen shots with dozens of these messages,\u201d said Mr. Streeter, who began driving full time for Lyft and then Uber in 2014 but quit last year to invest in real estate.\n\nMr. Streeter was not alone. For months, when drivers tried to log out, the app would frequently tell them they were only a certain amount away from making a seemingly arbitrary sum for the day, or from matching their earnings from that point one week earlier.\n\nThe messages were intended to exploit another relatively widespread behavioral tic \u2014 people\u2019s preoccupation with goals \u2014 to nudge them into driving longer.\n\nOver the past 20 years, behavioral economists have found evidence for a phenomenon known as income targeting, in which workers who can decide how long to work each day, like cabdrivers, do so with a goal in mind \u2014 say, $100 \u2014 much the way marathon runners try to get their time below four hours or three hours.\n\nWhile there is debate among economists as to how widespread the practice is and how strictly cabdrivers follow such targets, top officials at Uber and Lyft have certainly concluded that many of their drivers set income goals. \u201cOthers are motivated by an income target for sure,\u201d said Brian Hsu, the Lyft vice president in charge of supply. \u201cYou hear stories about people who want to buy that next thing.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019ve started to allow drivers to set up those goals as well in the app.\u201d\n\nUber even published a study last year, using its vast pile of data on drivers\u2019 rides and hours, finding that a \u201csubstantial, although not most, fraction of partners\u201d practice an extreme form of income targeting when they start on the platform, though they abandon it as they gain more experience. Strict income targeting is highly inefficient because it leads drivers to work long hours on days when business is slow and their hourly take is low, and to knock off early on days when business is brisk.\n\nRide-share companies can benefit if they get drivers to focus on dollar targets, instead of working only during the busiest times. Tip: Watch the hourly wage rates.\n\nThe beauty of the messages that Uber sent Mr. Streeter and his fellow drivers is that the drivers need not have even had a specific income goal in mind in order for the messages to work. Some of the most addictive games ever made, like the 1980s and \u201990s hit Tetris, rely on a feeling of progress toward a goal that is always just beyond the player\u2019s grasp. As the psychologist Adam Alter writes in his book \u201cIrresistible,\u201d this mental state has a name: the \u201cludic loop.\u201d (The term was coined by the anthropologist and slot machine expert Natasha Sch\u00fcll.)\n\nUber, for its part, appears to be aware of the ludic loop. In its messages to drivers, it included a graphic of an engine gauge with a needle that came tantalizingly close to, but was still short of, a dollar sign.\n\nAnd the ludic loop is far from the only video game feature that Uber has adapted as a way of keeping drivers on the road.\n\nAt any moment, the app shows drivers how many trips they have taken in the current week, how much money they have made, how much time they have spent logged on and what their overall rating from passengers is. All of these metrics can stimulate the competitive juices that drive compulsive game-playing.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is like a video game,\u201d said Eli Solomon, a veteran Uber and Lyft driver in the Chicago area, who said he sometimes had to fight the urge to work more after glancing at his data.\n\nSometimes the so-called gamification is quite literal. Like players on video game platforms such as Xbox, PlayStation and Pogo, Uber drivers can earn badges for achievements like Above and Beyond (denoted on the app by a cartoon of a rocket blasting off), Excellent Service (marked by a picture of a sparkling diamond) and Entertaining Drive (a pair of Groucho Marx glasses with nose and eyebrows).\n\nOf course, managers have been borrowing from the logic of games for generations, as when they set up contests and competition among workers. More overt forms of gamification have proliferated during the past decade. For example, Microsoft has used the approach to entice workers to perform the otherwise sleep-inducing task of software debugging.\n\nBut Uber can go much further. Because it mediates its drivers\u2019 entire work experience through an app, there are few limits to the elements it can gamify. Uber collects staggering amounts of data that allow it to discard game features that do not work and refine those that do. And because its workers are contractors, the gamification strategies are not hemmed in by employment law.\n\nKevin Werbach, a business professor who has written extensively on the subject, said that while gamification could be a force for good in the gig economy \u2014 for example, by creating bonds among workers who do not share a physical space \u2014 there was a danger of abuse. \u201cIf what you\u2019re doing is basically saying, \u2018We\u2019ve found a cheap way to get you to do work without paying you for it, we\u2019ll pay you in badges that don\u2019t cost anything,\u2019 that\u2019s a manipulative way to go about it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor some drivers, that is precisely the effect. Scott Weber said he drove full time most weeks last year, picking up passengers in the Tampa area for both Uber and Lyft, yet made less than $20,000 before expenses like gas and maintenance. \u201cI was a business that had a loss,\u201d said Mr. Weber, who is looking for another job. \u201cI\u2019m using payday loans.\u201d\n\nStill, when asked about the badges he earns while driving for Uber, Mr. Weber practically gushed. \u201cI\u2019ve got currently 12 excellent-service and nine great-conversation badges,\u201d he said in an interview in early March. \u201cIt tells me where I\u2019m at.\u201d\n\n\u2018Constantly Busy\u2019\n\nWhen asked whether Uber\u2019s product managers and data scientists were akin to developers at a social gaming company like Zynga, Jonathan Hall, Uber\u2019s head of economic and policy research, accepted the analogy but rejected the implication.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s something to that, but ultimately Zynga should worry mostly about how fun its games are rather than trying to get you to play a little bit more by some trick,\u201d he said. He argued that exploiting people\u2019s psychological tics was unlikely to have more than a marginal effect on how long they played Zynga\u2019s games or drove for Uber. It is \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hall is clearly right about the effects of certain techniques, like those pitched at drivers\u2019 tendency to set income targets or to focus more on losses than gains. On the other hand, even features that produce relatively small changes in driving patterns can become quite important to a company like Uber.\n\nAccording to Mr. Parker, the former Uber manager in Dallas, increasing the number of drivers on the road by 20 percent at certain hours of the day, or in a busy part of town, can rein in a large fare surge.\n\nMore important, some of the psychological levers that Uber pulls to increase the supply of drivers have quite powerful effects.\n\nConsider an algorithm called forward dispatch \u2014 Lyft has a similar one \u2014 that dispatches a new ride to a driver before the current one ends. Forward dispatch shortens waiting times for passengers, who may no longer have to wait for a driver 10 minutes away when a second driver is dropping off a passenger two minutes away.\n\nPerhaps no less important, forward dispatch causes drivers to stay on the road substantially longer during busy periods \u2014 a key goal for both companies.\n\nUber and Lyft explain this in essentially the same way. \u201cDrivers keep telling us the worst thing is when they\u2019re idle for a long time,\u201d said Kevin Fan, the director of product at Lyft. \u201cIf it\u2019s slow, they\u2019re going to go sign off. We want to make sure they\u2019re constantly busy.\u201d\n\nWhile this is unquestionably true, there is another way to think of the logic of forward dispatch: It overrides self-control.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent example is that such automatic queuing appears to have fostered the rise of binge-watching on Netflix. \u201cWhen one program is nearing the end of its running time, Netflix will automatically cue up the next episode in that series for you,\u201d wrote the scholars Matthew Pittman and Kim Sheehan in a 2015 study of the phenomenon. \u201cIt requires very little effort to binge on Netflix; in fact, it takes more effort to stop than to keep going.\u201d\n\nAs with viewers and binge-watching, many drivers appear to enjoy the forward-dispatch feature, which can increase earnings by keeping them busier. But it can also work against their interests by increasing the number of drivers on the road and defusing fare surges. And whether they enjoy it is separate from the question of agency \u2014 whether they have it, or whether the company does.\n\nUber officials say the feature initially produced so many rides at times that drivers began to experience a chronic Netflix ailment \u2014 the inability to stop for a bathroom break. Amid the uproar, Uber introduced a pause button.\n\n\u201cDrivers were saying: \u2018I can never go offline. I\u2019m on just continuous trips. This is a problem.\u2019 So we redesigned it,\u201d said Maya Choksi, a senior Uber official in charge of building products that help drivers. \u201cIn the middle of the trip, you can say, \u2018Stop giving me requests.\u2019 So you can have more control over when you want to stop driving.\u201d\n\nIt is true that drivers can pause the services\u2019 automatic queuing feature if they need to refill their tanks, or empty them, as the case may be. Yet once they log back in and accept their next ride, the feature kicks in again. To disable it, they would have to pause it every time they picked up a new passenger. By contrast, even Netflix allows users to permanently turn off its automatic queuing feature, known as Post-Play.\n\nThis pre-emptive hard-wiring can have a huge influence on behavior, said David Laibson, the chairman of the economics department at Harvard and a leading behavioral economist. Perhaps most notably, as Ms. Rosenblat and Luke Stark observed in an influential paper on these practices, Uber\u2019s app does not let drivers see where a passenger is going before accepting the ride, making it hard to judge how profitable a trip will be.\n\nSometimes all that is necessary is the mere setting of a so-called default. Because humans tend to be governed by inertia, automatically enrolling them in retirement savings plans and then allowing them to opt out results in far higher participation than letting them opt in. Making Post-Play the default can have the same effect.\n\n\u201cIf done right, these things can be socially beneficial,\u201d Mr. Laibson said. \u201cBut you can think of all sorts of choice architecture that are quite contrary to human well-being.\u201d\n\nEven Mr. Hall, the Uber research director who downplayed the importance of behavioral economics to the company, did make at least one concession. \u201cThe optimal default we set is that we want you to do as much work as there is to do,\u201d he said of the company\u2019s app. \u201cYou\u2019re not required to by any means. But that\u2019s the default.\u201d\n\nHaving more drivers on the road benefits ride-share companies, but drivers profit from surge pricing and scarcity in their ranks. Ride-share companies, which do not bear the direct costs of drivers being idle, want to have as many drivers available as possible. Simulation details: There are 20 drivers. During surge, prices increase by 2x and passenger requests are reduced by 30%. Passengers cancel after 10 minutes of waiting without a driver accepting their request. Regular fares cost $1 a minute, driver expenses are $0.10 a minute, and the app company takes a $1.50 booking fee plus 20% of the per-minute fees.\n\nImagining the Future\n\nThere are aspects of the platforms that genuinely do increase drivers\u2019 control over their work lives, as Uber frequently points out. Unlike most workers, an Uber driver can put in a few hours each day between dropping children off at school and picking them up in the afternoon.\n\nUber is even in the process of developing a feature that allows drivers to tell the app in advance that they need to arrive at a given location at a given time. \u201cIf you need to pick up your kids at soccer practice at 6 p.m.,\u201d said Nundu Janakiram, the Uber official in charge of products that improve drivers\u2019 experiences, \u201cit will start to give you trips to take you in the general direction to get to a specific place in time.\u201d\n\nThere is also the possibility that as the online gig economy matures, companies like Uber may adopt a set of norms that limit their ability to manipulate workers through cleverly designed apps.\n\nKelly Peters, chief executive of BEworks, a management consulting firm specializing in behavioral science, argued that the same data that makes it easier for Uber to nudge drivers into working an additional 30 or 60 minutes also makes it hard to escape the obligation to look after them.\n\nFor example, the company has access to a variety of metrics, like braking and acceleration speed, that indicate whether someone is driving erratically and may need to rest. \u201cThe next step may be individualized targeting and nudging in the moment,\u201d Ms. Peters said. \u201c\u2018Hey, you just got three passengers in a row who said they felt unsafe. Go home.\u2019\u201d Uber has already rolled out efforts in this vein in numerous cities.\n\nThat moment of maturity does not appear to have arrived yet, however. Consider a prompt that Uber rolled out this year, inviting drivers to press a large box if they want the app to navigate them to an area where they have a \u201chigher chance\u201d of finding passengers. The accompanying graphic resembles the one that indicates that an area\u2019s fares are \u201csurging,\u201d except in this case fares are not necessarily higher.\n\nSome drivers believe that the intent is to trick them into driving where Uber wants them to go, rather than where driving would be most profitable, by implying that they will find a surge there. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to move people where they want them,\u201d said Mr. Weber, the Tampa-area driver. \u201cBut you get there and it\u2019s nothing. It happens all the time.\u201d Mr. Weber noted that the design of the graphic makes the prompt much easier to accept than decline, which requires pressing a small rectangle in the top left corner.\n\nUber said that the feature was an experiment intended primarily to help new drivers who frequently say they do not know where to find passengers, and that it could be changed if drivers were dissatisfied.\n\nIndividual features aside, the broader question of how much Uber seeks to influence drivers through behavioral science may come down to how much its business model requires it.\n\nWhile the company has made no secret of its investment in self-driving cars, it could be a decade or more before they completely replace human drivers. In the meantime, as long as Uber continues to set growth and passenger volume as critical goals, it will have an incentive to make wringing more hours out of drivers a higher priority than the drivers\u2019 bottom line whenever it faces a close call between the two.\n\nIt will also have an incentive to obtain these hours as cheaply as possible. And there is simply no cheaper way than hiring contractors and nudging them to drive when and where they are needed. Industry insiders estimate that relying on independent contractors rather than employees can lower direct costs by roughly 25 percent.\n\nMoreover, the contractor model itself provides a strong impetus for companies like Uber to grow. Many companies in the gig economy simply do not have enough workers, or rich enough data about their workers\u2019 behavior, to navigate busy periods using nudges and the like. To avoid chronic understaffing, they have switched to an employee model that allows them to compel workers to log in when the companies most need them.\n\nOnce companies achieve a certain scale, on the other hand, they enter a virtuous cycle: The risk of understaffing drops with a big enough pool of workers, and the cost savings of using contractors begins to outweigh the inefficiencies. This in turn frees up money to enter new markets and acquire new customers, which makes the contractor model still more efficient, and throws off still more savings.\n\nIt is, as a result, not too hard to imagine a future in which massive digital platforms like Uber have an appetite for tens of millions of workers \u2014 not only for ferrying people, but also for delivering food and retail goods. Nor is it hard to imagine workers\u2019 obliging them, perhaps because their skills do not match the needs of more traditional employers, or because they need to supplement their wages.\n\nIn such an economy, experts say, using big data and algorithms to manage workers will not simply be a niche phenomenon. It may become one of the most common ways of managing the American labor force.\n\n\u201cYou have all these players entering into this space, and the assumption is they\u2019ll do it through vast armies of underemployed people looking for extra hours, and we can control every nuance about what they do but not have to pay them,\u201d said David Weil, the top wage-and-hour official under President Barack Obama.\n\nWhen you stop to consider the enormous cost advantages, Mr. Weil said, \u201cit says to me this is an area that will grow fast.\u201d", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAO3t7QAAACH/C1hNUCBEYXRhWE1QAT8AIfkEBQAAAAAsAAAAAAEAAQAAAgJEAQA7", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/06/business/uber-psychology-1490978613802/uber-psychology-1490978613802-facebookJumbo-v3.gif", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/20/business/20uber/20uber-mediumThreeByTwo225.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/04/business/04-UBER-01/04-UBER-01-mediumThreeByTwo225.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/03/07/uber/assets/header.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/22/business/22UBER1/22UBER1-mediumThreeByTwo225.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/22/business/23UBER1/23UBER1-mediumThreeByTwo225.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/29/business/29UBER2/29UBER2-mediumThreeByTwo225.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/03/07/uber/assets/header-bot.png"], "videos": []}
