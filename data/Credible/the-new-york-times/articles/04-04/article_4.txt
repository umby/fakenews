Right now, though, his mind was elsewhere. It was two minutes until airtime for \u201cThe Lead With Jake Tapper,\u201d and Tapper\u2019s featured guest was the President Trump counselor and noted CNN adversary Kellyanne Conway.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"866\" data-total-count=\"1564\">Conway\u2019s last interview on CNN, about a month earlier, had generated fireworks; she and Anderson Cooper spent nearly 25 minutes arguing about CNN\u2019s report on the secret dossier of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. (Conway: \u201cI know CNN is feeling the heat today, but I\u2019m gracious enough to come \u2014\u201d Cooper: \u201cI think <em>you guys</em> are feeling the heat.\u201d) The tension between Conway and the network had since become a kind of B story in the larger narrative of Trump\u2019s ongoing war with CNN, which the president had taken to characterizing as \u201cfake news.\u201d In response to calls for media outlets to boycott her, Conway told The Hollywood Reporter that she could \u201cput my shoes and pantyhose back on and go on any show at any time.\u201d And yet, when the White House offered Conway for Tapper\u2019s Sunday morning talk show, CNN declined, questioning her credibility.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"28\" data-total-count=\"1592\">But that was a few days ago.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"169\" data-total-count=\"1761\">\u201cShe looks shiny to me,\u201d one of the producers said as Conway\u2019s face appeared on a feed from the South Lawn of the White House. \u201cDo they have powder out there?\u201d</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-1\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\n    <div class=\"supplemental first\" id=\"supplemental-1\">\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\n<div class=\"story-interrupter\" id=\"story-continues-1\">\n    <div id=\"FlexAd\" class=\"ad flex-ad nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-2\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    <div class=\"flex-ad-creative\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-2\">\n        <script>\n\tif (window.magnum && window.magnum.responsiveImages && window.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage) {\n\t\twindow.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage('100000005020851','vertical-full-bleed',738,600,2.7,19.015384615385,15.2,1.2307692307692,'#000000');\n\t}\n</script>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"71\" data-total-count=\"1832\" id=\"story-continues-2\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Zucker assured him. \u201cShe looks fine.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"577\" data-total-count=\"2409\">The monitor next to Conway\u2019s featured a close shot of Tapper, starting his show in the studio down the hall.

Along the way, he survived two bouts of colon cancer and Bell\u2019s palsy, was blamed for killing quality television and has been accused of enabling the rise of Donald Trump. But he still loves TV.

The network\u2019s riveting coverage of the gulf war in 1991, beginning with a live broadcast from the Al-Rasheed Hotel \u2014 as the first American smart bombs exploded in the background \u2014 established the potential power and immediacy of 24-hour news, and elevated CNN to a cultural institution in the process. By the end of the \u201990s, though, it had lost its monopoly on the cable-news business. CNN\u2019s original mission was to \u201cmake the news the star,\u201d but this was not enough to guarantee an audience now that Fox News, with its decidedly nonneutral take, was an option. CNN needed an identity. Fox was the hearth, keeping the homes of conservatives warm; MSNBC would eventually become the consoling voice of perpetual liberal outrage. But what was CNN?</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-16\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-12\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"971\" data-total-count=\"8017\" id=\"story-continues-12\">As the network groped for an answer to this question, its increasingly desperate attempts to attract viewers, to turn news into BREAKING NEWS, transformed it into something of a late-night punch line. CNN still made plenty of money; the majority of its revenue comes not from advertising but from the fees cable providers pay to include it in their basic packages. And every now and then, a real breaking news event \u2014 a war, a natural disaster \u2014 would boost the network\u2019s ratings and justify its continued presence in the bundle. But an existential threat was looming. In a world where cable cutters were consuming their news in bite-size portions on their phones and streaming free video over the internet, how much longer would anyone be willing to pay for expensive cable packages? Real breaking-news events happened only every so often, and people lost interest in them quickly; more quickly than ever, in fact, now that there was so much else to distract them.</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-13\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\n    <div class=\"supplemental \" id=\"supplemental-3\">\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\n<div class=\"story-interrupter\" id=\"story-continues-13\">\n    <figure id=\"media-100000005020842\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-jumbo-horizontal media-100000005020842 ratio-tall\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn2/09cnn2-superJumbo.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn2/09cnn2-superJumbo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn2/09cnn2-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Jake Tapper in his office in Washington.\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Philip Montgomery for The New York Times\"  itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn2/09cnn2-superJumbo.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"1365\" />\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"2048\" />\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Jake Tapper in his office in Washington.</span>\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\n            Philip Montgomery for The New York Times        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-4\">\n        <script>\n\tif (window.magnum && window.magnum.responsiveImages && window.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage) {\n\t\twindow.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage('100000005020851','vertical-full-bleed',738,600,2.7,19.015384615385,15.2,1.2307692307692,'#000000');\n\t}\n</script>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"484\" data-total-count=\"8501\" id=\"story-continues-14\">But then along came a presidential candidate who was a human breaking-news event. Trump provided drama and conflict every time he opened his mouth. So too did his growing band of surrogates, who were paid by either the campaign or the network, and in one case both, to defend his statements. Indeed, it often seemed disconcertingly as though Trump had built his entire campaign around nothing so much as his singular ability to fill cable news\u2019s endless demand for engaging content.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-18\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-15\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1065\" data-total-count=\"9566\" id=\"story-continues-15\">Had Trump lost the election, CNN would probably have returned to its previously scheduled struggle for survival. Instead, it has become more central to the national conversation than at any point in the network\u2019s history since the first gulf war. And the man who is presiding over this historic moment at CNN happens to be the same one who was in some part responsible for Donald Trump\u2019s political career. It was Zucker who, as president of NBC Entertainment, broadcast \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d at a time when Trump was little more than an overextended real estate promoter with a failing casino business. That show, more than anything, reversed Trump\u2019s fortunes, recasting a local tabloid villain as the people\u2019s prime-time billionaire. And it was Zucker who, as president of CNN, broadcast the procession of made-for-TV events \u2014 the always news-making interviews; the rallies; debates; the \u201cmajor policy addresses\u201d that never really were \u2014 that helped turn Trump into the Republican front-runner at a time when few others took his candidacy seriously.</p><div id=\"story-ad-3\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-16\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"780\" data-total-count=\"10346\" id=\"story-continues-16\">CNN was hardly the only news organization to provide saturation coverage of the Trump campaign. The media-measurement firm mediaQuant calculated that Trump received the equivalent of $5.8 billion in free media \u2014 known as \u201cearned media,\u201d as opposed to paid advertising \u2014 over the course of the election, $2.9 billion more than Hillary Clinton. Nor is CNN the only cable-news network that has benefited from Trump\u2019s incarnation as a politician. MSNBC and Fox News each had a surge in ratings during the election that has shown no signs of slowing since then. Fox, the president\u2019s preferred outlet, is coming off the best quarter in the history of 24-hour cable news. MSNBC, the network of the resistance, has been thriving, too, often even beating CNN during prime time.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-20\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-17\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"807\" data-total-count=\"11153\" id=\"story-continues-17\">But CNN was the first major news organization to give Trump\u2019s campaign prolonged and sustained attention. He was a regular guest in the network\u2019s studios from the earliest days of the Republican primaries, often at Zucker\u2019s suggestion. (For a while, according to the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, Trump referred to Zucker as his \u201cpersonal booker.\u201d) When Trump preferred not to appear in person, he frequently called in. Nor did CNN ever miss an opportunity to broadcast a Trump rally or speech, building the suspense with live footage of an empty lectern and breathless chyrons: \u201cDONALD TRUMP EXPECTED TO SPEAK ANY MINUTE.\u201d The TV News Archive calculated that CNN mentioned Trump\u2019s name nearly eight times more frequently than that of the second-place finisher, Ted Cruz, during the primaries.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"467\" data-total-count=\"11620\">It\u2019s hard to imagine that either Trump or Zucker would be where he is today without the other. Trump\u2019s foray into reality TV gave Zucker a prime-time hit when he badly needed one; now, Trump\u2019s foray into politics has given Zucker a big story when he badly needed one. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship that could only thrive in the world of television, where the borders between news and entertainment, and even fantasy and reality, have grown increasingly murky.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"621\" data-total-count=\"12241\">In a sense, no one is better suited to navigate the terra incognita of Trump\u2019s America than Zucker. He made his name in television by turning an ailing \u201cToday\u201d show into a $450-million-a-year juggernaut with a mix of news and stunts, like staging weddings in Rockefeller Center and putting Matt Lauer in a copy of the Versace dress that Jennifer Lopez wore to the Grammys. At NBC Entertainment, he helped usher in the age of reality TV, first with the gross-out show \u201cFear Factor\u201d and then with \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Now he\u2019s running CNN at a moment when straight news has also become a form of entertainment.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"629\" data-total-count=\"12870\">Zucker likes to quote an early mentor at NBC, the late Tim Russert, considered by many the dean of the Sunday morning talk shows: \u201cThe primary responsibility of media is the accountability of government.\u201d But Zucker is also using the power of his medium in a very different way than the network has used it in the past. CNN\u2019s defining moments have historically involved another one of the responsibilities of journalism: bearing witness. The network\u2019s cameras have illuminated the darkest corners of the world, recording history as it was being made, whether it was in Iraq, Tiananmen Square or flood-ravaged New Orleans.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-24\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-18\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"422\" data-total-count=\"13292\" id=\"story-continues-18\">What Zucker is creating now is a new kind of must-see TV \u2014 produced almost entirely in CNN\u2019s studios \u2014 an unending loop of dramatic moments, conflicts and confrontations. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in the news, but I\u2019ve always been interested in what\u2019s popular,\u201d Zucker says. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a little bit of a populist take on things.

When I met him outside his Upper East Side apartment building early one morning in late February, he had been up for a couple of hours, watching the morning shows and reading the papers online. Even when he was working in Hollywood, Zucker was a news junkie; former colleagues at NBC remember him keeping one eye on cable news during pitch meetings, a habit that didn\u2019t always endear him to agents and writers.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"466\" data-total-count=\"14256\">That night, Trump would be delivering his first address to Congress. As we rode through Central Park in the back of a black Escalade toward CNN\u2019s offices, Zucker told me he was worried that CNN wasn\u2019t giving the event the attention it deserved. He showed me an email that he wrote to his morning and daytime hosts and producers at 6:41 a.m. \u201cI think we are underplaying how big a day this is from Trump,\u201d it concluded. \u201cGets another shot to start again.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad-4\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-21\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"729\" data-total-count=\"14985\" id=\"story-continues-21\">Zucker\u2019s predecessor was a CNN lifer named Jim Walton, who worked out of the network\u2019s longtime home in Atlanta. Walton was more businessman than newsman; employees and former employees don\u2019t recall him having a hand in editorial decisions. Zucker\u2019s fingerprints are on almost everything CNN does. Over the course of the weeks I spent with him, he was constantly thumbing his Blackberry, emailing producers and correspondents with suggestions and feedback. Walton rarely attended the daily 9 a.m. news meeting; Zucker presides over it. As the network\u2019s different departments and shows run through their preliminary plans for the day, he makes it clear which stories he wants them to play up and which ones he doesn\u2019t.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-28\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-22\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"565\" data-total-count=\"15550\" id=\"story-continues-22\">When we arrived at CNN\u2019s offices on the Upper West Side, the daytime set \u2014 built right in the middle of the newsroom, to give the broadcast a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 feel \u2014 was still dark. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet now, but it won\u2019t be for long,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d In a studio two floors up, Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota, the hosts of \u201cNew Day,\u201d were broadcasting live from a set designed to look like a living room. Cuomo was grilling Representative Steve King, the Iowa Republican, who was inside the Capitol, about the repeal of Obamacare.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"773\" data-total-count=\"16323\">Zucker\u2019s last TV job, as president and chief executive of NBC Universal, came with a huge corner office atop Rockefeller Center. At CNN, his setup is comparatively modest but seems to suit his metabolism and inclination toward micromanagement: His small office opens onto the newsroom, his desk positioned to face a wall of 11 television screens, so he can constantly monitor his network and its competitors. Zucker was met with a mixture of enthusiasm and wariness when he arrived at CNN in 2013. He had a reputation for intensity and competitiveness, which were both in short supply at CNN. But he was also known for being obsessed with ratings. \u201cYou could feel the ground shaking,\u201d one former CNN producer told me. \u201cThis iconic television producer was coming.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-30\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-23\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"709\" data-total-count=\"17032\" id=\"story-continues-23\">Zucker\u2019s tenure at CNN started inauspiciously. He talked about the need to \u201cbroaden the definition of news\u201d and joked about replacing a pillow in one executive\u2019s office that said \u201cCNN = Politics\u201d with one that read \u201cCNN &gt; Politics.\u201d There were several short-lived experiments in programming, including the return of a warmed-over \u201cCrossfire,\u201d starring Newt Gingrich. Zucker\u2019s news judgment was publicly and repeatedly called into question: In 2015, Jon Stewart devoted a large part of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d to mocking CNN for broadcasting the White House Correspondents Dinner rather than covering the protests after a black man, Freddie Gray, died in the custody of the Baltimore Police.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"334\" data-total-count=\"17366\">Absent a war or a natural disaster, Zucker cast around for an event that might capture the national attention. For 24 hours, the network went all-in on a cruise ship that was adrift with a broken sewage system and then devoted weeks to the mysterious disappearance of a Malaysian airplane. Don Lemon <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/02/27/cnn-tonight-pierre-the-llama-live-with-don-lemon.cnn\">interviewed a llama</a> in prime time.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-32\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-24\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1287\" data-total-count=\"18653\" id=\"story-continues-24\">The era of searching is over. Zucker has found a story to ride, \u201cthe biggest story we could ever imagine,\u201d he says. And as it turns out, the only thing better than having Donald Trump on your network is having him attack it. Far from hurting CNN, Trump\u2019s war against it has amounted to a form of product placement \u2014 \u201cearned media,\u201d you could say \u2014 giving its anchors and correspondents starring roles in the ongoing political drama, turning them into camera-ready warriors for the First Amendment. Zucker has not shied away from the conflict, which has been reassuring, even inspiring, to his staff. \u201cI hate to sound like a fanboy, but he\u2019s the best boss I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Tapper, a former senior White House correspondent at ABC News, told me. It has also been good for business. Last year, CNN\u2019s average daytime audience was up more than 50 percent, and its prime-time audience 70 percent. The network earned nearly $1 billion; it was the most profitable year in CNN\u2019s history. Ratings are up again this year, which is expected to be more profitable still. And CNN\u2019s newfound relevance may not be fully monetized until a few years from now, when its parent company, Turner Broadcasting System, renegotiates subscription fees with a variety of cable providers.</p><figure id=\"media-100000005020843\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-vertical media-100000005020843\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn3/09cnn3-blog427.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn3/09cnn3-blog427.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn3/09cnn3-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Anderson Cooper, left, Jeffrey Lord and Kirsten Powers at CNN in Washington.\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Philip Montgomery for The New York Times\"  itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn3/09cnn3-blog427.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"641\" />\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"427\" />\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Anderson Cooper, left, Jeffrey Lord and Kirsten Powers at CNN in Washington.</span>\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\n            Philip Montgomery for The New York Times        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"993\" data-total-count=\"19646\">In his early months on the job, Zucker laid off journalists. Lately, he has been on a hiring spree, in particular for CNN\u2019s digital operation. He brought on the veteran investigative reporters Carl Bernstein and James Steele to write for CNN\u2019s website and appear on TV and poached BuzzFeed\u2019s four-person investigative political-research team, \u201cK-File,\u201d led by Andrew Kaczynski. CNN.com has scored some big scoops in recent months. It was the first to report on the existence of Trump\u2019s Russia dossier, and it broke the story that the White House had asked the F.B.I. to publicly reject media reports that people close to Trump were in contact with the Russians during the campaign. Not only do stories like these generate traffic for CNN\u2019s website, but they provide news for its hosts to discuss on-air. And while the numbers are dwarfed by those on the TV side, the network\u2019s digital operation has become a revenue generator in its own right, bringing in $300 million in 2016.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"938\" data-total-count=\"20584\">Perched on the window sill of Zucker\u2019s office, among the pictures of his family, is a framed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seacorc/status/762510741920329729\">cartoon</a> of him shaking hands with Trump. \u201cAnother Trump stooge on the payroll, Don Don!\u201d a plump-looking Zucker says. \u201cBig league move, Zucker,\u201d Trump replies. It was drawn by the political cartoonist Sean Corcoran last summer, when CNN hired the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as a contributor just days after he was fired by the campaign. I was surprised to find it in Zucker\u2019s office. His critics saw the hiring of Lewandowski \u2014 who was accused of assaulting a female reporter and was still getting paychecks from the campaign during his five-month stint at CNN \u2014 as emblematic of everything that was wrong with Zucker and CNN. Namely, that he was more interested in staging fights and creating spectacles than in producing journalism. But Zucker doesn\u2019t engage in second-guessing, let alone soul-searching.</p><div id=\"story-ad-5\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-25\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"181\" data-total-count=\"20765\" id=\"story-continues-25\">\u201cI don\u2019t like that cartoon,\u201d said CNN\u2019s chief marketing officer, Allison Gollust, who was in Zucker\u2019s office when I asked about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you framed it.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-36\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-26\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"60\" data-total-count=\"20825\" id=\"story-continues-26\">\u201cI like it,\u201d Zucker replied. \u201cI think it\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"965\" data-total-count=\"21790\"><strong>In the 1960s, </strong>the vice president for audience measurement at NBC developed the theory of the \u201cleast-objectionable program,\u201d which held that most TV watchers were basically passive consumers, looking less for something that they wanted to watch than for something that didn\u2019t offend them. For years, this theory governed programming decisions at all of the networks. But by the time Jeff Zucker left \u201cToday\u201d to take over as president of NBC Entertainment in 2001, it was beginning to feel outdated. People just had too many choices now, with the proliferation of cable channels like HBO, which were producing content of their own. The economics of the business were also changing. The stars of hit shows like \u201cFriends,\u201d the centerpiece of the network\u2019s \u201cMust See TV\u201d lineup, were demanding bigger paychecks, even as the networks\u2019 overall audiences were shrinking. It was becoming too expensive to produce sitcoms and dramas with ensemble casts.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"726\" data-total-count=\"22516\">About two years into Zucker\u2019s tenure, the producer Mark Burnett walked into his office on the NBC lot in Burbank, Calif., with a possible solution: A new reality-TV show called \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d in which a group of contestants would compete for a job with Donald Trump. Zucker, who spent the 1990s in New York, knew that Trump would ensure that the show received no shortage of publicity. But Burnett was the real object of his pursuit. A former British paratrooper, Burnett was responsible for \u201cSurvivor,\u201d which introduced the reality game-show genre to American television. Zucker was already broadcasting a \u201cSurvivor\u201d knockoff, \u201cFear Factor\u201d; it was one of his few successes since arriving in Los Angeles.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"833\" data-total-count=\"23349\">Trump wasn\u2019t at the pitch meeting for \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and it was unclear if he would even return for the second season. But after watching the rough cuts a few months later, Zucker and his top reality-TV executive, Jeff Gaspin, could see that the scenes of Trump sitting in judgment inside the ersatz boardroom that NBC had built for him inside Trump Tower were the best part of the show. (\u201cSex sells,\u201d Trump declared at the conclusion of the first episode, after the show\u2019s women fared better than its men at running lemonade stands.) \u201cEverything was just the catalyst for the boardroom,\u201d Gaspin recalls. \u201cThe rest of it was pretty standard contestant dynamics, but the boardroom was tense and really engaging.\u201d Gaspin and Zucker asked Burnett to expand these set pieces, and Trump became the star of the show.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"770\" data-total-count=\"24119\">Zucker had found his replacement for at least one of NBC\u2019s Thursday-night hits. Instead of watching a charming group of 20-somethings navigate the bumpy transition to adulthood, a large swath of the country now watched a politically incorrect loudmouth berate aspiring entrepreneurs. If there were any lingering doubts, \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d proved that the era of the \u201cleast-objectionable program\u201d was over. In fact, the one thing audiences <em>didn\u2019t</em> want was neutral programming. They wanted intrigue, cattiness, chaos and Darwinian, winner-take-all battles for success and survival. It didn\u2019t matter what was real and what wasn\u2019t, and the central characters didn\u2019t even need to be likable. They just had to be watchable and, ideally, compulsively watchable.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-40\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-27\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"390\" data-total-count=\"24509\" id=\"story-continues-27\">Before long, Zucker was introducing Trump to advertisers as the man who saved NBC. But Zucker saved Trump, too. He had been through four bankruptcies at this point, with a fifth and sixth around the corner. And yet, in just a few years\u2019 time, Trump would have his own star on Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame and would be dreaming of leveraging his new celebrity into a bid for the White House.</p><figure id=\"09mag-cnn-pullquote1\" class=\"interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small\">\n    \n    \n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\n            </figcaption>\n\n        <div class=\"interactive-graphic\">\n        <script>function getFlexData() { return {\"data\":{\"quote\":\" \u2018I\u2019ve always had a little bit of a populist take on things.

At the after-parties, his kids posed with Trump at his boardroom table. Zucker half-jokingly tried to persuade Trump to let him televise his wedding to Melania at Mar-a-Lago in 2005. He failed, but attended as a guest and ribbed Trump about the wedding at a Friar\u2019s Club roast beforehand. (There would be a cigar room for Trump\u2019s friends and a bouncy castle for Melania\u2019s, Zucker said.)</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-42\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-28\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"841\" data-total-count=\"25869\" id=\"story-continues-28\">Having Trump as \u201ctalent\u201d came with certain obligations. There was the weekly phone call, during which Trump would boast about his latest ratings or complain about the performance of the shows leading into \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d When Trump wanted to create a scripted fictional show called \u201cThe Tower\u201d \u2014 like \u201cDynasty,\u201d only about a group of models who live in a Manhattan skyscraper \u2014 Zucker instructed his development team to buy the pitch and hire a writer, even though he never intended to put it on TV. (Even before there was a script, Trump had a casting demand: They had to hire real models, not actresses.) When Trump told reporters, incorrectly, that \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was the most popular show on TV, Zucker would roll his eyes and laugh. \u201cJeff got a kick out of it,\u201d Gaspin says. \u201cIt was just television.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad-6\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-29\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"196\" data-total-count=\"26065\" id=\"story-continues-29\">Last spring, as Trump was steaming toward the Republican nomination, Zucker ran into him in the men\u2019s room in the network\u2019s Washington bureau.

This is a problem for not only the aspiring politician; it\u2019s also one for cable-news networks, which rely heavily on choreographed panel debates to provide inexpensive, lively programming.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"339\" data-total-count=\"26963\">In the summer of 2015, after appearing on Anderson Cooper\u2019s show, Trump complained to CNN that his interviews on the network were always followed by conversations among panelists who all seemed to hate him. The network asked Trump to suggest the names of some people who would defend him. One of those whom he mentioned was Jeffrey Lord.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1284\" data-total-count=\"28247\">Trump and Lord had met a couple of years earlier, in 2013. Lord was living with his elderly mother in Harrisburg, Pa., writing unpublished thrillers and screenplays. A former White House associate director for political affairs in the Reagan administration, he also dabbled in radio and TV political commentary and had written a few pieces about Trump for the right-wing magazine The American Spectator, including one headlined \u201cNever Ignore Donald Trump.\u201d The Spectator asked Lord to introduce Trump at a dinner at a hotel in Washington. Soon after that, Trump called Lord and proposed that they fly to Washington together on his plane. Lord was excited, but he hesitated; who would take care of his mother? A cousin in Binghamton, N.Y., not wanting Lord to miss the opportunity, offered to cover his caretaking duties for the night. The logistics were complex: Lord drove to Washington, parked his car near the hotel and took the train up to New York to meet Trump. He would fly down to D.C. with Trump and then drive straight home to his mother in Harrisburg when the dinner was over. \u201cI went to Trump Tower and they took me right up, and he was in there in his office,\u201d Lord says. \u201cWe just hit it off. He took me up to the penthouse while he went to change his shirt.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-48\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-31\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1080\" data-total-count=\"29327\" id=\"story-continues-31\">Lord made his CNN debut in July 2015. Two weeks later, CNN offered him a job as the network\u2019s first pro-Trump contributor. (CNN said it was already considering Lord and that Trump\u2019s suggestion had no effect on their decision to hire him.) Today, he is one of 12 Trump partisans on CNN\u2019s payroll and perhaps the network\u2019s most reliable, if mild-mannered, provocateur; he recently defended Trump\u2019s tweet that Obama had orchestrated a \u201cNixon/Watergate\u201d wiretapping plot against him, saying that the president was just speaking \u201cAmericanese.\u201d The network sends a black town car four days a week to ferry him to Manhattan from Harrisburg and back, a three-hour drive each way. Lord has long since become a celebrity in Harrisburg \u2014 he was profiled on the front-page of the local newspaper \u2014 and now is recognized pretty much wherever he goes. The only CNN show he prefers not to do is Don Lemon\u2019s, because it gets him back to his mother, who is now 97, too late. \u201cI don\u2019t get home until 1 in the morning; that gets a little difficult for Mom,\u201d he told me.</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-32\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\n    <div class=\"supplemental \" id=\"supplemental-5\">\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\n<div class=\"story-interrupter\" id=\"story-continues-32\">\n    <figure id=\"media-100000005020844\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-jumbo-horizontal media-100000005020844 ratio-tall\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn4/09cnn4-superJumbo.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn4/09cnn4-superJumbo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn4/09cnn4-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Jim Acosta, CNN&rsquo;S senior White House correspondent, on the White House lawn.\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Philip Montgomery for The New York Times\"  itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn4/09cnn4-superJumbo.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"1463\" />\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"2048\" />\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Jim Acosta, CNN\u2019S senior White House correspondent, on the White House lawn.</span>\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\n            Philip Montgomery for The New York Times        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-6\">\n        <script>\n\tif (window.magnum && window.magnum.responsiveImages && window.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage) {\n\t\twindow.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage('100000005020851','vertical-full-bleed',738,600,2.7,19.015384615385,15.2,1.2307692307692,'#000000');\n\t}\n</script>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"734\" data-total-count=\"30061\" id=\"story-continues-33\">CNN\u2019s Last-Supper-size panels have become a hallmark of its political coverage. Many of the network\u2019s most memorable moments during the campaign were protracted emotional face-offs among paid partisans. Lord was often involved, typically with his anti-Trump sparring partner, Van Jones, another CNN employee. One night when Trump was under fire for failing to immediately denounce David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Lord rallied to his defense with a kamikaze historical attack, calling the K.K.K. \u201cthe military arm, the terrorist arm of the Democratic Party.\u201d Jones, who is black, responded with an impassioned dressing-down: \u201cI don\u2019t care how they voted 50 years ago. I care about who they killed.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-50\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-34\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1111\" data-total-count=\"31172\" id=\"story-continues-34\">As pure TV spectacle, arguments like this were reminiscent of the head-to-head battles pioneered a decade ago by ESPN\u2019s daytime talk shows like \u201cFirst Take,\u201d which pitted sports pundits against one another in loud disagreements about the topic of the day. This was not a coincidence. Zucker is a big sports fan and from the early days of the campaign had spoken at editorial meetings about wanting to incorporate elements of ESPN\u2019s programming into CNN\u2019s election coverage. \u201cThe idea that politics is sport is undeniable, and we understood that and approached it that way,\u201d he told me. Toward that end, the network built \u201cpregame\u201d sets outside debate halls with excited crowds in the background and created a temporary rooftop studio for the final weeks of the campaign with sweeping views of the White House and the Washington Monument. An on-screen countdown clock ticked down the days (then hours) to Nov. 8. Trump, the trash-talking (and trash-Tweeting) underdog who inspired raw, powerful feelings among supporters and detractors alike, was the ideal subject for this narrative framework.</p><figure class=\"media video youtube embedded layout-large-horizontal\">\n        <iframe class=\"video-bind\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//youtube.com/embed/mUIs5K2Snpk?wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"description\"><span class=\"caption-text\"></span> <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">Video by CNN</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"881\" data-total-count=\"32053\">Van Jones told me that he thinks Lord has played a valuable role at CNN, helping its viewers understand the Trump phenomenon. \u201cHe\u2019s a Trump translator, really, for the whole country,\u201d Jones said. But CNN\u2019s pro-Trump voices often seem better suited to generating friction than to offering insights. At a postelection panel sponsored by Harvard University, Zucker\u2019s alma mater, a political reporter for The Washington Post, Karen Tumulty, drew cheers when she pressed him about his willingness to provide a platform to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/jeff-zucker-harvard-heckled-cnn-trump-coverage-232090\">nut-job surrogates</a>\u201d like Katrina Pierson, the Trump campaign spokeswoman who asserted on CNN that President Obama invaded Afghanistan. Zucker surely knew that his hiring of Lewandowski would create controversy and in turn give his anchors something to talk about. That is exactly what happened: The hiring became a cable-news story about cable news.</p><div id=\"story-ad-7\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-35\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"376\" data-total-count=\"32429\" id=\"story-continues-35\">As Zucker sees it, his pro-Trump panelists are not just spokespeople for a worldview; they are \u201ccharacters in a drama,\u201d members of CNN\u2019s extended ensemble cast. \u201cEverybody says, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t believe you have Jeffrey Lord or Kayleigh McEnany,\u2019 but you know what?\u201d Zucker told me with some satisfaction. \u201cThey know who Jeffrey Lord and Kayleigh McEnany are.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"378\" data-total-count=\"32807\"><strong>Zucker lives about</strong> 10 blocks from Trump Tower, and three of his four children still attend the same Upper West Side private school as Trump\u2019s youngest son, Barron. \u201cI like Donald,\u201d Zucker told me, before quickly correcting himself. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t call him that.

Zucker was fired after Comcast purchased NBC Universal in 2011. He left with his reputation tarnished, having made a high-profile blunder in the late-night wars: He moved Jay Leno to prime time, an instant ratings debacle.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-56\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-37\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"495\" data-total-count=\"33936\" id=\"story-continues-37\">By the time Zucker\u2019s name came up for the CNN job in 2012, both he and the 24-hour news network seemed to some people like relics of a different era in television. One of those who lobbied on his behalf was Trump. He sang Zucker\u2019s praises to Turner Broadcasting System\u2019s chief executive at the time, Phil Kent, who was in charge of hiring for the position, when the two were seated next to each other at a black-tie charity dinner at the Plaza Hotel hosted by the American Turkish Society.</p><figure id=\"09mag-cnn-pullquote2\" class=\"interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small\">\n    \n    \n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\n            </figcaption>\n\n        <div class=\"interactive-graphic\">\n        <script>function getFlexData() { return {\"data\":{\"quote\":\" \u2018I like Donald.

CNN\u2019s anchors \u2014 Tapper in particular \u2014 did some of the toughest interviews with Trump, who would sometimes call Zucker afterward to complain, often going on expletive-laden rants. After securing the nomination, though, Trump made the calculation that he would be better off simply turning against certain media outlets. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, carried the message to Zucker in June, not long after CNN took the unprecedented step of fact-checking Trump\u2019s statements \u2014 a large number of which were completely untrue \u2014 in real-time with on-screen chyrons. Kushner told Zucker over the phone that in the future, Trump would be doing interviews with only friendly outlets.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"345\" data-total-count=\"35042\">Zucker, who attended Kushner\u2019s wedding to Ivanka Trump in 2009, said that he thought this was a mistake. He suggested that Kushner speak to one of his contributors, the former Obama campaign official David Axelrod, whose research for Obama showed that CNN\u2019s viewers represent a key voting bloc. \u201cYou can\u2019t win without us,\u201d Zucker said.</p><div id=\"story-ad-8\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-38\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"327\" data-total-count=\"35369\" id=\"story-continues-38\">For Zucker, the thick-skinned TV executive and newsman, it was just business. For Trump, the thin-skinned TV star and now approval-craving politician, it was tactical but also personal: He believed that he had gotten Zucker his job at CNN and that the network\u2019s increasingly aggressive coverage of him was an act of betrayal.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-60\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-39\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"794\" data-total-count=\"36163\" id=\"story-continues-39\">Trump actually didn\u2019t play a meaningful role in Zucker\u2019s hiring. (\u201cThe president is certainly entitled to believe whatever he likes about our conversation,\u201d Kent wrote me in an email, \u201chowever, it was not a factor in the decision to hire Jeff.\u201d) But after the second presidential debate in October, when several CNN panelists criticized Trump for dismissing his comments about grabbing women by the genitals as \u201clocker-room talk,\u201d Zucker received an email from Trump, via his campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks: \u201cJeff \u2014 Too bad you (CNN) couldn\u2019t be honest with how well I did in the debate. The dumbest thing I ever did was get you the job at CNN \u2014 you are the most disloyal person. Just remember, I always seem to find a way to get even. Best wishes, Donald J. Trump.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"660\" data-total-count=\"36823\"><strong>For a network</strong> that had self-consciously emulated the drama-ratcheting techniques of sports programming, the election could not have concluded in more fitting fashion than with the underdog Trump defying the oddsmakers, turning what was expected to be a blowout into a nail-biter. Zucker, running CNN\u2019s coverage from the Washington control room on election night, kept the network\u2019s cameras trained on the anchor John King as he worked the Magic Wall \u2014 the large touch-screen map that has been the centerpiece of CNN\u2019s election-night coverage since 2008 \u2014 pointing, tapping and sweeping his way through the biggest upset in American political history.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"680\" data-total-count=\"37503\">Not until midnight, when Trump\u2019s victory appeared certain, did Zucker finally redirect the cameras to CNN\u2019s panelists for reactions and analysis. Lord declared Trump\u2019s probable election a \u201cmiracle.\u201d Jones congratulated Lord on his candidate\u2019s likely victory but then quickly added: \u201cPeople have talked about a miracle. I\u2019m hearing about a nightmare.\u201d A spontaneous, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdgewCeLtrU\">moving monologue</a> followed, with Jones, visibly shaken, calling the results a \u201cwhitelash\u201d and wondering how parents would explain the election to their children in the morning.

It was pitched as a kind of rapprochement, but Trump instead used the occasion to berate his guests. He called out CNN in particular, accusing it of dishonest reporting. \u201cHe was attacking CNN, but in a little more of a playful way, because he knew me,\u201d Zucker says. \u201cHe was being an ass but in a playful way.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad-9\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-44\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"898\" data-total-count=\"39269\" id=\"story-continues-44\">The other members of the media \u2014 who would come under heavy criticism for agreeing to subject themselves to this semipublic scolding, and in an off-the-record setting \u2014 dispersed when the meeting was over. Zucker stayed behind for a photo shoot with Trump for CNN\u2019s coffee-table book on the election. The network had wanted to photograph both candidates during the campaign and put the winner on the cover, but Trump wasn\u2019t willing to sit for a picture until he had won. Zucker went upstairs to Trump\u2019s offices and hung around for the shoot. \u201cHe was incredibly chummy with me, incredibly friendly,\u201d Zucker says. \u201cIt was the old Donald-and-Jeff relationship \u2014 the relationship of two people who have known each other for 15 years, who had a long relationship, who always had a cordial relationship. And by the way, the photographer took several photos of me and Donald together.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-68\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-45\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"680\" data-total-count=\"39949\" id=\"story-continues-45\">Zucker had breakfast with Kushner a few weeks later in Manhattan. Kushner wanted to know why CNN still hadn\u2019t fired anti-Trump commentators like Jones and Ana Navarro, who said on CNN in October that every Republican would have to answer the question of what they did the day they saw a tape of \u201cthis man boasting about grabbing a woman\u2019s pussy.\u201d (The comment elicited an angry response from one of CNN\u2019s pro-Trump talking heads, Scottie Nell Hughes: \u201cWill you please stop saying that word?\u201d <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/08/us/cnn-panel-trump-language/\">she demanded</a>. \u201cMy daughter is listening.\u201d) Zucker tried to explain that even though Trump won, the network still needed what he described as \u201ca diversity of opinion.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"446\" data-total-count=\"40395\">Shortly before Trump was sworn in, Zucker heard that he was considering giving Fox News exclusive rights to televise the inauguration and that Kushner was in the process of brokering a deal with Rupert Murdoch, whom Kushner once courted as a mentor. Zucker called Trump. \u201cBottom line is that I said, \u2018This is crazy,\u2019\u2009\u201d Zucker recalls. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to give your inaugural coverage to your base of support? It makes no sense.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-70\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-46\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"554\" data-total-count=\"40949\" id=\"story-continues-46\">The men last spoke a few nights before Christmas. The president-elect was home in Trump Tower watching CNN. Earlier that day, he tweeted that he would have run a different campaign and done even better in the election \u2014 \u201cif that is possible\u201d \u2014 if the outcome were determined by popular vote. Brianna Keilar, sitting in for Wolf Blitzer, asked Rebecca Berg, a reporter for RealClearPolitics and a political analyst for CNN, what she made of Trump\u2019s fixation on the election results. She described it as \u201ca little bit unseemly, unflattering.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"153\" data-total-count=\"41102\">Trump vented to Zucker one final time. \u201cHe completely trashed her for two minutes,\u201d Zucker recalls, \u201csays, \u2018O.K., got it?\u2019 and then hung up.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-72\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-47\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"219\" data-total-count=\"41321\" id=\"story-continues-47\">Trump has only stepped up his attacks on CNN since then and has even publicly taunted Zucker, telling the network\u2019s senior White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, on live TV to \u201cask Jeff Zucker how he got his job.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"229\" data-total-count=\"41550\">When Trump gave his first news conference after the election, he refused to call on CNN. Acosta, who was emailing with Zucker, tried repeatedly to get a question in. \u201cNot you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYour organization is terrible.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"553\" data-total-count=\"42103\"><strong>In February, Zucker</strong> commissioned a survey of the public\u2019s perception of CNN, to see whether the president\u2019s war against the network was having any effect on its reputation. Zucker reviewed the report on a recent morning with the network\u2019s senior staff members and audience-research team. The results were not surprising. Few people had been swayed by Trump\u2019s criticisms. If they considered CNN a trustworthy source of news beforehand, they most likely still did; if they considered it unreliable or biased, that probably hadn\u2019t changed either.</p><div id=\"story-ad-10\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-48\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"390\" data-total-count=\"42493\" id=\"story-continues-48\">What had changed was that people on both sides had stronger feelings about CNN. \u201cI was taken aback by realizing through this that we are no longer a utility,\u201d one member of the network\u2019s research team answered when Zucker asked for her take-away. \u201cWe actually have a personality now that people either hate or love, whereas we used to be a little more milquetoast in their minds.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-76\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-49\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"405\" data-total-count=\"42898\" id=\"story-continues-49\">It was another way of saying that CNN is no longer neutral programming. There\u2019s an obvious correlation between this transformation and CNN\u2019s recent success. It\u2019s not what\u2019s least objectionable that people want, it\u2019s what\u2019s most objectionable. Controversy and conflict attract attention, especially when Donald Trump is at the center of it all. Not that Zucker needed a survey to tell him that.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"275\" data-total-count=\"43173\">During the Republican National Convention last summer in Cleveland, Trump called Jeffrey Lord on his cellphone while he was on live with Anderson Cooper in CNN\u2019s studio in the convention hall. Lord paused to take the call and then <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/CNNW_20160721_210000_Situation_Room_With_Wolf_Blitzer/start/4870/end/4930\">reported on their conversation</a> on the air.</p><button class=\"button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large\" data-skip-to-para-id=\"\">\n</button>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"498\" data-total-count=\"43671\">\u201cAnderson, I\u2019ve just heard from Donald Trump himself,\u201d he said. \u201cHe thinks that this convention has been a tremendous convention. He has a message for you, Anderson: He is not pleased. He thinks that we\u2019re not accurately representing this convention.\u201d Lord moved on to Trump\u2019s one indisputable claim: \u201cHe specifically said to say that your ratings, our ratings at CNN here, are up because of his presence in this convention. And I think I\u2019ve more or less delivered the message.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-78\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-50\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"589\" data-total-count=\"44260\" id=\"story-continues-50\">After he finished the segment, Lord left CNN\u2019s makeshift studio and bumped into Zucker, sitting in the convention hallway in a golf cart. \u201cI said, \u2018I guess you didn\u2019t see this, but Trump called me on air,\u2019\u2009\u201d Lord recalled. \u201cHe jumps off the cart, and I tell him the whole story.\u201d Having been on the other end of these outraged phone calls from Trump himself, Zucker had only one question. \u201cThe very first thing he said is, \u2018You didn\u2019t use an expletive on the air, did you?\u2019 I said no. Then he grabs me by the lapels and says, \u2018That is great television!\u2019\u2009\u201d<span class=\"tombstone\"><i class=\"icon\"></i></span></p><div id=\"addenda\" class=\"addenda\">\n    <div class=\"story-addendum story-content theme-correction\">\n        <strong> Correction: April 4, 2017 </strong> <br/>\n        <p>An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of CNN&rsquo;s communications director.

Donald Trump Solved It.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/magazine/cnn-had-a-problem-donald-trump-solved-it.html", "date": "04-04-2017", "source": "the-new-york-times", "text": "Zucker wakes up every day at 5:15 a.m., without the help of an alarm clock or coffee. When I met him outside his Upper East Side apartment building early one morning in late February, he had been up for a couple of hours, watching the morning shows and reading the papers online. Even when he was working in Hollywood, Zucker was a news junkie; former colleagues at NBC remember him keeping one eye on cable news during pitch meetings, a habit that didn\u2019t always endear him to agents and writers.\n\nThat night, Trump would be delivering his first address to Congress. As we rode through Central Park in the back of a black Escalade toward CNN\u2019s offices, Zucker told me he was worried that CNN wasn\u2019t giving the event the attention it deserved. He showed me an email that he wrote to his morning and daytime hosts and producers at 6:41 a.m. \u201cI think we are underplaying how big a day this is from Trump,\u201d it concluded. \u201cGets another shot to start again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZucker\u2019s predecessor was a CNN lifer named Jim Walton, who worked out of the network\u2019s longtime home in Atlanta. Walton was more businessman than newsman; employees and former employees don\u2019t recall him having a hand in editorial decisions. Zucker\u2019s fingerprints are on almost everything CNN does. Over the course of the weeks I spent with him, he was constantly thumbing his Blackberry, emailing producers and correspondents with suggestions and feedback. Walton rarely attended the daily 9 a.m. news meeting; Zucker presides over it. As the network\u2019s different departments and shows run through their preliminary plans for the day, he makes it clear which stories he wants them to play up and which ones he doesn\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen we arrived at CNN\u2019s offices on the Upper West Side, the daytime set \u2014 built right in the middle of the newsroom, to give the broadcast a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 feel \u2014 was still dark. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet now, but it won\u2019t be for long,\u201d Zucker said. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d In a studio two floors up, Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota, the hosts of \u201cNew Day,\u201d were broadcasting live from a set designed to look like a living room. Cuomo was grilling Representative Steve King, the Iowa Republican, who was inside the Capitol, about the repeal of Obamacare.\n\nZucker\u2019s last TV job, as president and chief executive of NBC Universal, came with a huge corner office atop Rockefeller Center. At CNN, his setup is comparatively modest but seems to suit his metabolism and inclination toward micromanagement: His small office opens onto the newsroom, his desk positioned to face a wall of 11 television screens, so he can constantly monitor his network and its competitors. Zucker was met with a mixture of enthusiasm and wariness when he arrived at CNN in 2013. He had a reputation for intensity and competitiveness, which were both in short supply at CNN. But he was also known for being obsessed with ratings. \u201cYou could feel the ground shaking,\u201d one former CNN producer told me. \u201cThis iconic television producer was coming.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZucker\u2019s tenure at CNN started inauspiciously. He talked about the need to \u201cbroaden the definition of news\u201d and joked about replacing a pillow in one executive\u2019s office that said \u201cCNN = Politics\u201d with one that read \u201cCNN > Politics.\u201d There were several short-lived experiments in programming, including the return of a warmed-over \u201cCrossfire,\u201d starring Newt Gingrich. Zucker\u2019s news judgment was publicly and repeatedly called into question: In 2015, Jon Stewart devoted a large part of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d to mocking CNN for broadcasting the White House Correspondents Dinner rather than covering the protests after a black man, Freddie Gray, died in the custody of the Baltimore Police.\n\nAbsent a war or a natural disaster, Zucker cast around for an event that might capture the national attention. For 24 hours, the network went all-in on a cruise ship that was adrift with a broken sewage system and then devoted weeks to the mysterious disappearance of a Malaysian airplane. Don Lemon interviewed a llama in prime time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe era of searching is over. Zucker has found a story to ride, \u201cthe biggest story we could ever imagine,\u201d he says. And as it turns out, the only thing better than having Donald Trump on your network is having him attack it. Far from hurting CNN, Trump\u2019s war against it has amounted to a form of product placement \u2014 \u201cearned media,\u201d you could say \u2014 giving its anchors and correspondents starring roles in the ongoing political drama, turning them into camera-ready warriors for the First Amendment. Zucker has not shied away from the conflict, which has been reassuring, even inspiring, to his staff. \u201cI hate to sound like a fanboy, but he\u2019s the best boss I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Tapper, a former senior White House correspondent at ABC News, told me. It has also been good for business. Last year, CNN\u2019s average daytime audience was up more than 50 percent, and its prime-time audience 70 percent. The network earned nearly $1 billion; it was the most profitable year in CNN\u2019s history. Ratings are up again this year, which is expected to be more profitable still. And CNN\u2019s newfound relevance may not be fully monetized until a few years from now, when its parent company, Turner Broadcasting System, renegotiates subscription fees with a variety of cable providers.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn his early months on the job, Zucker laid off journalists. Lately, he has been on a hiring spree, in particular for CNN\u2019s digital operation. He brought on the veteran investigative reporters Carl Bernstein and James Steele to write for CNN\u2019s website and appear on TV and poached BuzzFeed\u2019s four-person investigative political-research team, \u201cK-File,\u201d led by Andrew Kaczynski. CNN.com has scored some big scoops in recent months. It was the first to report on the existence of Trump\u2019s Russia dossier, and it broke the story that the White House had asked the F.B.I. to publicly reject media reports that people close to Trump were in contact with the Russians during the campaign. Not only do stories like these generate traffic for CNN\u2019s website, but they provide news for its hosts to discuss on-air. And while the numbers are dwarfed by those on the TV side, the network\u2019s digital operation has become a revenue generator in its own right, bringing in $300 million in 2016.\n\nPerched on the window sill of Zucker\u2019s office, among the pictures of his family, is a framed cartoon of him shaking hands with Trump. \u201cAnother Trump stooge on the payroll, Don Don!\u201d a plump-looking Zucker says. \u201cBig league move, Zucker,\u201d Trump replies. It was drawn by the political cartoonist Sean Corcoran last summer, when CNN hired the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as a contributor just days after he was fired by the campaign. I was surprised to find it in Zucker\u2019s office. His critics saw the hiring of Lewandowski \u2014 who was accused of assaulting a female reporter and was still getting paychecks from the campaign during his five-month stint at CNN \u2014 as emblematic of everything that was wrong with Zucker and CNN. Namely, that he was more interested in staging fights and creating spectacles than in producing journalism. But Zucker doesn\u2019t engage in second-guessing, let alone soul-searching.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that cartoon,\u201d said CNN\u2019s chief marketing officer, Allison Gollust, who was in Zucker\u2019s office when I asked about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you framed it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI like it,\u201d Zucker replied. \u201cI think it\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s, the vice president for audience measurement at NBC developed the theory of the \u201cleast-objectionable program,\u201d which held that most TV watchers were basically passive consumers, looking less for something that they wanted to watch than for something that didn\u2019t offend them. For years, this theory governed programming decisions at all of the networks. But by the time Jeff Zucker left \u201cToday\u201d to take over as president of NBC Entertainment in 2001, it was beginning to feel outdated. People just had too many choices now, with the proliferation of cable channels like HBO, which were producing content of their own. The economics of the business were also changing. The stars of hit shows like \u201cFriends,\u201d the centerpiece of the network\u2019s \u201cMust See TV\u201d lineup, were demanding bigger paychecks, even as the networks\u2019 overall audiences were shrinking. It was becoming too expensive to produce sitcoms and dramas with ensemble casts.\n\nAbout two years into Zucker\u2019s tenure, the producer Mark Burnett walked into his office on the NBC lot in Burbank, Calif., with a possible solution: A new reality-TV show called \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d in which a group of contestants would compete for a job with Donald Trump. Zucker, who spent the 1990s in New York, knew that Trump would ensure that the show received no shortage of publicity. But Burnett was the real object of his pursuit. A former British paratrooper, Burnett was responsible for \u201cSurvivor,\u201d which introduced the reality game-show genre to American television. Zucker was already broadcasting a \u201cSurvivor\u201d knockoff, \u201cFear Factor\u201d; it was one of his few successes since arriving in Los Angeles.\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t at the pitch meeting for \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and it was unclear if he would even return for the second season. But after watching the rough cuts a few months later, Zucker and his top reality-TV executive, Jeff Gaspin, could see that the scenes of Trump sitting in judgment inside the ersatz boardroom that NBC had built for him inside Trump Tower were the best part of the show. (\u201cSex sells,\u201d Trump declared at the conclusion of the first episode, after the show\u2019s women fared better than its men at running lemonade stands.) \u201cEverything was just the catalyst for the boardroom,\u201d Gaspin recalls. \u201cThe rest of it was pretty standard contestant dynamics, but the boardroom was tense and really engaging.\u201d Gaspin and Zucker asked Burnett to expand these set pieces, and Trump became the star of the show.\n\nZucker had found his replacement for at least one of NBC\u2019s Thursday-night hits. Instead of watching a charming group of 20-somethings navigate the bumpy transition to adulthood, a large swath of the country now watched a politically incorrect loudmouth berate aspiring entrepreneurs. If there were any lingering doubts, \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d proved that the era of the \u201cleast-objectionable program\u201d was over. In fact, the one thing audiences didn\u2019t want was neutral programming. They wanted intrigue, cattiness, chaos and Darwinian, winner-take-all battles for success and survival. It didn\u2019t matter what was real and what wasn\u2019t, and the central characters didn\u2019t even need to be likable. They just had to be watchable and, ideally, compulsively watchable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore long, Zucker was introducing Trump to advertisers as the man who saved NBC. But Zucker saved Trump, too. He had been through four bankruptcies at this point, with a fifth and sixth around the corner. And yet, in just a few years\u2019 time, Trump would have his own star on Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame and would be dreaming of leveraging his new celebrity into a bid for the White House.\n\nZucker would occasionally visit the set and never missed the live season finales. \u201cThey were huge events for us,\u201d he says. At the after-parties, his kids posed with Trump at his boardroom table. Zucker half-jokingly tried to persuade Trump to let him televise his wedding to Melania at Mar-a-Lago in 2005. He failed, but attended as a guest and ribbed Trump about the wedding at a Friar\u2019s Club roast beforehand. (There would be a cigar room for Trump\u2019s friends and a bouncy castle for Melania\u2019s, Zucker said.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHaving Trump as \u201ctalent\u201d came with certain obligations. There was the weekly phone call, during which Trump would boast about his latest ratings or complain about the performance of the shows leading into \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d When Trump wanted to create a scripted fictional show called \u201cThe Tower\u201d \u2014 like \u201cDynasty,\u201d only about a group of models who live in a Manhattan skyscraper \u2014 Zucker instructed his development team to buy the pitch and hire a writer, even though he never intended to put it on TV. (Even before there was a script, Trump had a casting demand: They had to hire real models, not actresses.) When Trump told reporters, incorrectly, that \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was the most popular show on TV, Zucker would roll his eyes and laugh. \u201cJeff got a kick out of it,\u201d Gaspin says. \u201cIt was just television.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast spring, as Trump was steaming toward the Republican nomination, Zucker ran into him in the men\u2019s room in the network\u2019s Washington bureau. Trump was powdering his face before an interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou think any of this would have happened without \u2018The Apprentice?\u2019 \u201d Trump asked, as Zucker moved past him.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Zucker answered.\n\nOne challenge of running for president without ever having put forward a policy proposal, let alone assembled a political staff, is that you don\u2019t have a natural constituency of talking heads to champion your candidacy. This is a problem for not only the aspiring politician; it\u2019s also one for cable-news networks, which rely heavily on choreographed panel debates to provide inexpensive, lively programming.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, after appearing on Anderson Cooper\u2019s show, Trump complained to CNN that his interviews on the network were always followed by conversations among panelists who all seemed to hate him. The network asked Trump to suggest the names of some people who would defend him. One of those whom he mentioned was Jeffrey Lord.\n\nTrump and Lord had met a couple of years earlier, in 2013. Lord was living with his elderly mother in Harrisburg, Pa., writing unpublished thrillers and screenplays. A former White House associate director for political affairs in the Reagan administration, he also dabbled in radio and TV political commentary and had written a few pieces about Trump for the right-wing magazine The American Spectator, including one headlined \u201cNever Ignore Donald Trump.\u201d The Spectator asked Lord to introduce Trump at a dinner at a hotel in Washington. Soon after that, Trump called Lord and proposed that they fly to Washington together on his plane. Lord was excited, but he hesitated; who would take care of his mother? A cousin in Binghamton, N.Y., not wanting Lord to miss the opportunity, offered to cover his caretaking duties for the night. The logistics were complex: Lord drove to Washington, parked his car near the hotel and took the train up to New York to meet Trump. He would fly down to D.C. with Trump and then drive straight home to his mother in Harrisburg when the dinner was over. \u201cI went to Trump Tower and they took me right up, and he was in there in his office,\u201d Lord says. \u201cWe just hit it off. He took me up to the penthouse while he went to change his shirt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLord made his CNN debut in July 2015. Two weeks later, CNN offered him a job as the network\u2019s first pro-Trump contributor. (CNN said it was already considering Lord and that Trump\u2019s suggestion had no effect on their decision to hire him.) Today, he is one of 12 Trump partisans on CNN\u2019s payroll and perhaps the network\u2019s most reliable, if mild-mannered, provocateur; he recently defended Trump\u2019s tweet that Obama had orchestrated a \u201cNixon/Watergate\u201d wiretapping plot against him, saying that the president was just speaking \u201cAmericanese.\u201d The network sends a black town car four days a week to ferry him to Manhattan from Harrisburg and back, a three-hour drive each way. Lord has long since become a celebrity in Harrisburg \u2014 he was profiled on the front-page of the local newspaper \u2014 and now is recognized pretty much wherever he goes. The only CNN show he prefers not to do is Don Lemon\u2019s, because it gets him back to his mother, who is now 97, too late. \u201cI don\u2019t get home until 1 in the morning; that gets a little difficult for Mom,\u201d he told me.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn7-cover/09cnn7-cover-articleLarge-v5.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn4/09cnn4-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn5/09cnn5-superJumbo-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn2/09cnn2-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn6/09cnn6-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn3/09cnn3-blog427.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn7-cover/06cnn7-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/magazine/09cnn1/09cnn1-superJumbo.jpg"], "videos": []}
