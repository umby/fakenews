class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"805\" data-total-count=\"805\"><span class=\"dropcap\">O</span>n Monday, Jan. 9, less than two weeks before President Trump\u2019s inauguration, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, hosted a dinner at his office in the Capitol with members of Trump\u2019s inner circle. The guests included the president-elect\u2019s chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; his son-in-law and family consigliere, Jared Kushner; his chief of staff, Reince Priebus; his economic adviser, Gary Cohn; his nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin; his incoming deputy chief of staff, Rick Dearborn; and his legislative-affairs director, Marc Short. The ostensible purpose of the dinner was to discuss the details of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda \u2014 in particular, the prospects for a sweeping tax-reform measure that Republicans, and especially Ryan, have been coveting for the past decade.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"670\" data-total-count=\"1475\">It was hoped that the dinner could also establish some sort of common ground between Ryan and Bannon, the two figures who would arguably wield the greatest influence over how Trump\u2019s campaign promises became law \u2014 or didn\u2019t. Ryan was a fixture among establishment Republicans even before joining Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential ticket in 2012, his previous labors on the House Budget Committee cementing his reputation as the charts-and-graphs wizard of fiscal conservatism. Bannon, by contrast, was a renegade autodidact who read Plato and had seemingly materialized from nowhere to become the intellectual architect of Trump\u2019s campaign and, later, administration.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"708\" data-total-count=\"2183\">Up to this point, Ryan had epitomized to Bannon everything that was wrong with the Republican Party. Discussing the two parties\u2019 shortcomings, Bannon later told me, \u201cWhat\u2019s that Dostoyevsky line: Happy families are all the same, but unhappy families are unhappy in their own unique ways?\u201d (He meant Tolstoy.) \u201cI think the Democrats are fundamentally afflicted with the inability to discuss and have an adult conversation about economics and jobs, because they\u2019re too consumed by identity politics. And then the Republicans, it\u2019s all this theoretical Cato Institute, Austrian economics, limited government \u2014 which just doesn\u2019t have any depth to it. They\u2019re not living in the real world.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"748\" data-total-count=\"2931\">Breitbart News, the far-right media outlet Bannon ran before becoming the chief executive of the Trump campaign in August, had described Ryan, referring to his position on immigration, as \u201carguably the most pro-amnesty G.O.P. lawmaker in Congress\u201d \u2014 an apostasy of nearly impeachable proportions from Bannon\u2019s perspective. Worst of all, Ryan all but abandoned Trump during the 2016 campaign. After the leak in October of the damaging \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, Ryan told fellow Republican House members on a conference call, \u201cI am not going to defend Donald Trump \u2014 not now, not in the future.\u201d A Republican lawmaker on the call told Trump what Ryan had said, yet another reason for Bannon to regard himself as Ryan\u2019s worst enemy.</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-1\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\n    <div class=\"supplemental first\" id=\"supplemental-1\">\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\n<div class=\"story-interrupter\" id=\"story-continues-1\">\n    <div id=\"FlexAd\" class=\"ad flex-ad nocontent robots-nocontent\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-2\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    <div class=\"flex-ad-creative\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-2\">\n        <script>\n\tif (window.magnum && window.magnum.responsiveImages && window.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage) {\n\t\twindow.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage('100000005008400','vertical-full-bleed',729,600,0,0,0,0,'#000000');\n\t}\n</script>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"521\" data-total-count=\"3452\" id=\"story-continues-2\">But as the dinner progressed, it became clear that Bannon and Ryan actually had some ideas in common. Over memorably bad chicken Parmesan, Ryan described his vision for a \u201cborder-adjustment tax,\u201d which would levy taxes on imports while offering exemptions for exports. His tax package would include \u201cimmediate expensing,\u201d he explained, in which capital expenditures would be written off against profits in the first year rather than over time.

Now they had Bannon\u2019s attention. Taken together with a drastic reduction in corporate taxes, Bannon believed, Ryan\u2019s scheme would spur a renaissance of a manufacturing-based export economy, producing high-income labor in keeping with Trump\u2019s populism. \u201cI would actually say,\u201d Bannon remembers observing admiringly, \u201cthat this tax reform comes as close to a first step of economic nationalism as there is.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"87\" data-total-count=\"4009\">\u201cI would call it \u2018responsible nationalism,\u2019\u2009\u201d Ryan said, according to Bannon.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"109\" data-total-count=\"4118\">Bannon laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of folks in the Senate say this is breathtakingly radical.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad-1\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-3\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"581\" data-total-count=\"4699\" id=\"story-continues-3\">He meant it as a compliment. To Bannon, the entire world order \u2014 from the two political parties to the Wall Street reliance on leveraging to multiculturalism \u2014 was undergoing an extraordinary realignment, one made manifest in the 2016 election. According to Bannon\u2019s vision, economic nationalism would reorient priorities to the working class\u2019s benefit. Trade deals, jobs programs, tax incentives, immigration restrictions, environmental deregulation and even foreign policy would ultimately serve to restore the primacy of those Trump called \u201cthe forgotten Americans.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-4\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-4\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"446\" data-total-count=\"5145\" id=\"story-continues-4\">In March, when I spoke to Trump by phone, I asked him what the term \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d meant to him. Compared with Bannon\u2019s revolutionary fervor, his reply was surprisingly cautious. \u201cWell, \u2018nationalism\u2019 \u2014 I define it as people who love the country and want it to do good,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see \u2018nationalism\u2019 as a bad word. I see it as a very positive word. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t trade with other countries.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"649\" data-total-count=\"5794\">Trump\u2019s tone was genial but also a touch defensive. His postelection honeymoon had been short, if it existed at all. There were the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/trump-white-house-aides-strategy.html\">administrative intrigues</a> and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/11/real-donald-trump-twitter-delete-account/\">self-inflicted Twitter drama</a>, along with the questions about his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html\">campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia</a>, which had already forced the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html\">resignation</a> of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Still, Trump\u2019s legislative liaisons and their counterparts on Capitol Hill were doggedly negotiating a rollout of the Trump Era, one that would fulfill his most significant campaign promises \u2014 those that could not be done with just a stroke of Trump\u2019s own pen but required acts of Congress.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-6\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-5\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"601\" data-total-count=\"6395\" id=\"story-continues-5\">First, Obamacare would be repealed and replaced. Next, an austere budget would be passed, with emergency funds allotted for the construction of a wall along the Southern border. Then would come a tax-reform plan, presumably of the type Ryan and Bannon discussed. And finally, a bipartisan coalition would deliver a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Trump\u2019s desk. If all this came to pass by the end of 2017, it would lend some credence to Trump\u2019s pledge that this would be \u201cthe busiest Congress we\u2019ve had in decades.\u201d But by March, this timetable was looking like a formidable \u201cif.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"564\" data-total-count=\"6959\">Trump himself seemed prone to distraction as he spoke to me from the Oval Office. Though I was asking about his policy aims, his musings swerved off to other vexations. More than once he denounced as \u201cfake news\u201d reports about his administration\u2019s supposed disharmony. He brought up his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/trump-address-congress.html\">speech</a> before the joint session of Congress in February, \u201cwhich I hope you liked, but I certainly have gotten great reviews \u2014 even the people who hate me gave me the highest review.\u201d During the call, I could hear Priebus nearby, occasionally murmuring encouragement.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-8\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-6\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"641\" data-total-count=\"7600\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Trump sounded more clipped and less jaunty on the call than he did during the discursive chats I had with him last year on the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/magazine/donald-trump-primary-win.html\">campaign trail</a>. The business of governing had little to do with any trade he had previously practiced. In Congress, he was grappling with an arcane and famously inefficient ecosystem over which he had little if any control \u2014 and people he incessantly derided on the campaign trail as being \u201call talk and no action.\u201d I asked him if he still felt that way. \u201cIt\u2019s like any other industry,\u201d he replied, somewhat morosely. \u201cI\u2019ve met some great politicians and some, to be honest, who aren\u2019t so hot.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"681\" data-total-count=\"8281\">Trump wanted to make sure that he was given adequate credit for his achievements, even in his administration\u2019s infancy. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been here for a tiny speck of time,\u201d he said, \u201cand what I\u2019ve done with regulations, moving jobs back into the country, what I\u2019ve done with airplane pricing and buying is amazing. We\u2019ve done a lot. I think we\u2019ve done more than anybody for this short period of time.\u201d Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson would take exception to this claim. And Trump\u2019s significant actions to date have consisted entirely of executive orders. What he has not yet demonstrated is his ability to actually shepherd a bill into law.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-10\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-7\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"715\" data-total-count=\"8996\" id=\"story-continues-7\">The only major legislation that congressional committees have even seen thus far is a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, which met with a stunning rebuke from Trump\u2019s own party, forcing Ryan to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/us/politics/health-care-affordable-care-act.html\">withdraw the measure</a> on the afternoon of March 24. At this stage of his presidency, Barack Obama had already signed into law his $787 billion economic-stimulus package and had moved on to holding White House meetings on health care. It\u2019s conceivable that Trump could hit Day 100 with only minor symbolic legislative achievements to his name. For him to avoid this ignominy, the 45th president will have to develop a rapport with Washington\u2019s 535 federal deal makers, including the ones who \u201caren\u2019t so hot.\u201d</p>        <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-8\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    </div><!-- close story-body -->\n    <div class=\"supplemental \" id=\"supplemental-2\">\n    </div><!-- close supplemental -->\n</div><!-- close story-body-supplemental -->\n<div class=\"story-interrupter\" id=\"story-continues-8\">\n    <figure id=\"media-100000005008267\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-jumbo-horizontal media-100000005008267 ratio-tall\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump1/02trump1-superJumbo.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump1/02trump1-superJumbo.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump1/02trump1-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Donald Trump in the Oval Office on March 21.\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Christopher Anderson/Magnum, for The New York Times\"  itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump1/02trump1-superJumbo.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"1367\" />\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"2048\" />\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Donald Trump in the Oval Office on March 21.</span>\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\n            Christopher Anderson/Magnum, for The New York Times        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-3\">\n        <script>\n\tif (window.magnum && window.magnum.responsiveImages && window.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage) {\n\t\twindow.magnum.responsiveImages.setCoverImage('100000005008400','vertical-full-bleed',729,600,0,0,0,0,'#000000');\n\t}\n</script>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1225\" data-total-count=\"10221\" id=\"story-continues-9\"><strong>Whether Trump\u2019s agenda </strong>succeeds will also depend in no small measure on the ability of Bannon to expand his game beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. At 63, and with a fortune reported to be in the tens of millions of dollars \u2014 partly through his investment in the company that owns the syndication rights to \u201cSeinfeld\u201d \u2014 Bannon is regarded by Trump as a peer in the way that, say, the 45-year-old lifelong politico Priebus is not. He is also approvingly seen as a fellow workaholic by the president (whose only known hobbies are golf and hate-watching CNN). And he is a deft operator who has learned from the successes and failures of other Trump advisers. He has carefully not claimed credit that the president would wish for himself and avoids giving expansive interviews on his own controversial views that might detract from his boss\u2019s celebrity. Like the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Bannon understands that power in Trump World derives mainly from close and sustained physical proximity to the boss. Unlike Lewandowski, Bannon immediately grasped the importance of maintaining close relations with Jared Kushner, who factored heavily in Lewandowski\u2019s dismissal from the Trump campaign last summer.<br></p><div id=\"story-ad-2\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-10\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"426\" data-total-count=\"10647\" id=\"story-continues-10\">But like Kushner, Bannon has never worked in government or at a policy-making institute and has no meaningful experience when it comes to getting legislation passed. On the Hill, he has a few random associations \u2014 Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative John Culberson of Texas among them. Otherwise, he remains a looming but indistinct presence to the lawmakers who will be needed to pass most of Trump\u2019s agenda.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"411\" data-total-count=\"11058\">Bannon\u2019s interest in this agenda predated his association with Trump. One evening in January 2013, two guests showed up for dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that Bannon liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. One was the man Bannon would later describe to me as his \u201cmentor\u201d: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. The other was Sessions\u2019s top aide and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a jittery 27-year-old named Stephen Miller.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"667\" data-total-count=\"11725\">Two months earlier, Obama decisively defeated Mitt Romney in the presidential election, prompting Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to commission an analysis of the state of the party and its future, known colloquially in Washington as the \u201cautopsy,\u201d which would be delivered that spring. The only certainty was that the report would urge Republicans to court the growing Latino electorate \u2014 which had voted for Obama by a 44-point margin that November \u2014 by championing comprehensive immigration reform. The three men at the dinner table that night were among the few Republicans in town who thoroughly rejected that conclusion.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"587\" data-total-count=\"12312\">Bannon wanted to talk to Sessions and Miller about a different report: an article written by Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst for the website RealClearPolitics, titled \u201c<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/11/08/the_case_of_the_missing_white_voters_116106.html\">The Case of the Missing White Voters</a>.\u201d Trende observed that Obama\u2019s victory was less a function of increased minority turnout than of the fact that 6.6 million white voters who participated in the 2008 election stayed home in 2012. The reason for this drop, Trende argued, was that white working-class voters who did not approve of Obama but were alienated by Romney\u2019s perceived elitism had not voted.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-16\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-11\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"735\" data-total-count=\"13047\" id=\"story-continues-11\">These votes were gettable, Bannon believed. As he would later tell me: \u201cThe working class, and in particular the lower middle class, understands something that\u2019s so obvious \u2014 which is that they\u2019ve basically underwritten the rise of China. Their jobs, their raises, their retirement accounts have all fueled the private equity and venture capital that built China. Because China\u2019s really built on investments and exports, right? People are smart enough to know that they\u2019re getting played by both political parties. The two may be different on social issues, but when it comes to fundamental economics, they\u2019re both the same. That\u2019s why the American working class is interested in trade. It\u2019s linked to their lives.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"517\" data-total-count=\"13564\">Sessions shared Bannon\u2019s belief that the Republican Party needed to emphasize immigration reduction, border security and the preservation of working-class jobs through trade policy rather than courting Latino voters with a bill he regarded as \u201camnesty.\u201d As Sessions would write in a memorandum to his Republican colleagues six months later, \u201cThis humble and honest populism \u2014 in contrast to the administration\u2019s cheap demagoguery \u2014 would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-18\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-12\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"493\" data-total-count=\"14057\" id=\"story-continues-12\">At some point during the five-hour dinner, Bannon recalls blurting out to Sessions, \u201cWe have to run you for president.\u201d Just two years earlier, in 2011, he made a similar pitch to Sarah Palin, after completing a documentary about her called \u201cThe Undefeated.\u201d Palin demurred. She was enjoying her life of celebrity and wealth, she had done little to immerse herself in policy minutiae and she was no doubt unsettled by Bannon\u2019s warning that she stood little chance of defeating Obama.</p><div id=\"story-ad-3\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-13\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"645\" data-total-count=\"14702\" id=\"story-continues-13\">Now he delivered a similar message to Sessions. \u201cLook, you\u2019re not going to win,\u201d he recalls saying. \u201cBut you can get the Republican nomination. And once you control the apparatus, you can make fundamental changes. Trade is No.100 on the party\u2019s list. You can make it No.1. Immigration is No.10.

Trump had been a marginal figure at most in politics up to that point, entertaining a Reform Party run in the 2000 election \u2014 when he speculated that he would probably take more votes from the Democratic candidate than the Republican one \u2014 and leading a conspiratorial crusade in 2011 to force Obama to release his birth certificate. The possibility that he might be a suitable host body for Bannon\u2019s worldview had not occurred to Bannon before Trump spoke.</p><figure id=\"media-100000005008399\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005008399 ratio-tall\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump5/02thrump5-master675.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump5/02thrump5-master675.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump5/02thrump5-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"President Trump delivering his first address to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 28.\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\"  itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump5/02thrump5-master675.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"440\" />\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"675\" />\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">President Trump delivering his first address to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 28.</span>\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\n            Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"642\" data-total-count=\"15962\">But Trump\u2019s grousing references to China\u2019s economic superiority, to 11 million \u201cillegals\u201d and to the erosion of America\u2019s manufacturing sector were right out of Bannon\u2019s playbook. From his desk in the Russell Senate Office Building, Stephen Miller, too, watched Trump\u2019s speech. By 2014, Miller was sending emails to friends expressing the hope that Trump would run for president. By the time Trump announced his candidacy, in June 2015, Sessions was officially uncommitted but privately of the view that Trump was best suited to tap into the movement that he, Miller and Bannon discussed over dinner more than two years earlier.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"877\" data-total-count=\"16839\">Bannon\u2019s early support for Trump was manifest in Breitbart\u2019s breathless coverage of his candidacy. In an email he sent on Aug. 30, 2015, to his former filmmaking partner Julia Jones, Bannon explained that while Republican candidates like Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina were \u201call great,\u201d Trump represented a superior choice, because he \u201cis a nationalist who embraces Senator Sessions\u2019s plan\u201d on immigration. Still, recalls Sam Nunberg, Trump\u2019s first campaign strategist, \u201cSteve kept all of his cards.\u201d He added: \u201cHe was respectful to some of the other ones who were running, like Walker and Cruz and Carson. He didn\u2019t want to be seen as Trump-bart.\u201d When Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/us/politics/trump-belittles-mccains-war-record.html\">publicly disparaged</a> John McCain\u2019s war-hero credentials, Bannon \u2014 himself a Navy veteran \u2014 called Nunberg and demanded that Trump issue an apology. (Trump did not.)</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"915\" data-total-count=\"17754\">Bannon was well positioned as a supportive but not sycophantic observer by Aug. 13, 2016, when the Trump donor Rebekah Mercer read with alarm a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-gop.html\">New York Times account</a> of the Trump campaign\u2019s inability to handle its mercurial candidate. At Mercer\u2019s behest, Bannon (whose website Mercer\u2019s family helped underwrite) and Kellyanne Conway (who at that point was receiving money from both a Mercer family political action committee and the Trump campaign) flew out that day to East Hampton, N.Y., where Trump was attending a dinner fund-raiser at the home of the New York Jets\u2019 owner, Woody Johnson. After the dinner, Bannon and Conway huddled with the candidate. Bannon remembers telling Trump, who at the time was trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits in the polls, \u201cAs long as you stick to the message\u201d \u2014 by which he meant economic nationalism \u2014 \u201cyou have a 100 percent probability of winning.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-24\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-15\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"772\" data-total-count=\"18526\" id=\"story-continues-15\">A week after the election, in an <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steve-bannon-trump-tower-interview-trumps-strategist-plots-new-political-movement-948747\">interview</a> with the journalist Michael Wolff, Bannon offered a bold, sweeping sketch of what the vision might mean in policy terms: \u201cLike [Andrew] Jackson\u2019s populism, we\u2019re going to build an entirely new political movement. It\u2019s everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy.\u201d Of course, some of the conservatives Bannon intended to drive crazy possessed the congressional votes Bannon and Trump would need to advance this agenda. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a leading conservative in the House, told me in March, \u201cI would argue that populism, as long as it\u2019s rooted in conservative principle, is a darn good thing.\u201d Jordan was smiling as he said it, but the note of warning was hard to mistake.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"338\" data-total-count=\"18864\"><strong>The last time</strong> the Republican Party controlled all branches of government in Washington was from 2003 to 2007. During that period, the United States military toppled Saddam Hussein, Congress delivered tax cuts for the wealthy and President George W. Bush appointed the reliably conservative jurist Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1029\" data-total-count=\"19893\">But in the collective view of conservatives, these years of the Bush presidency were mostly characterized by betrayal and disappointment. Goaded by Bush, congressional Republicans passed into law a new federal entitlement (prescription drugs for senior citizens, also known as Medicare Part D), ran up the deficit, promoted democratic ideals overseas in the feckless manner of Woodrow Wilson, considered a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and confirmed a Supreme Court chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr., whose swing vote would later <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html\">save Obamacare</a> from judicial evisceration. \u201cMy go-to line when I first ran in 2008 was, \u2018Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House \u2014 and they blew it,\u2019\u2009\u201d Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told me. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got all three again, and I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s in Congress, not running for it.

Selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia was \u201cthe best thing the president did in his first 50 days,\u201d Chaffetz told me. He and his conservative colleagues have been cheered by Trump\u2019s recruitment of former House colleagues and conservative stalwarts like Vice President Mike Pence; Tom Price, the health and human services secretary; and Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-28\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-17\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"681\" data-total-count=\"21210\" id=\"story-continues-17\">When Chaffetz and I spoke in March, he had met with the president twice so far \u2014 access he considered \u201csuch a huge sea change\u201d from the stony silence Republicans say they encountered from the Obama White House. Most important, the Trump agenda\u2019s first three projected legislative moves \u2014 the Obamacare repeal and replacement, an austere budget and tax reform \u2014 were intended to keep conservatives happily in Trump\u2019s camp. In turn, when the agenda moved on to less conservative items like infrastructure and trade agreements, Trump and Bannon would fully expect Republicans, including Ryan, to remember whose message resonated most with working-class voters last year.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"573\" data-total-count=\"21783\">Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, is Trump\u2019s chief point of contact on the Hill. When McCarthy was a college student and budding entrepreneur in Bakersfield, Calif., in the late 1980s, his girlfriend at the time, now his wife, Judy, gave him an autographed copy of Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cI thought it was great,\u201d he told me. In McCarthy\u2019s view, Trump is a master of today\u2019s media, much as Lincoln and Kennedy were in their own times. \u201cHe\u2019s mastered instantaneous Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like owning newspapers.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-30\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-18\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"577\" data-total-count=\"22360\" id=\"story-continues-18\">Trump has found a kindred spirit in McCarthy, a coastal extrovert of ambiguous ideological portfolio who (unlike Ryan) would far rather talk about personalities than the tax code. And as the former minority leader in the California Legislature during the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger, McCarthy is experienced in the care and feeding of celebrity egos. Since Trump\u2019s nomination, the two have spoken frequently by phone \u2014 to date, Trump has never been known to directly email or text anyone \u2014 about the cast of 535 characters with whom the president must now deal.</p><figure id=\"media-100000005008268\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005008268\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump2/02trump2-master675.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump2/02trump2-master675.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump2/02trump2-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Stephen K.

And McCarthy\u2019s recent track record in obtaining majorities has not been the greatest. In his previous capacity as House whip, he was thwarted by members of his own party when it came to subjects as diverse as reauthorizing a Patriot Act they deemed too intrusive, a farm bill they considered too expensive and a border-security bill they regarded as too lenient. His most reliable obstacles have been the three dozen or so House conservatives known as the Freedom Caucus, a two-year-old group of fiscal hard-liners. Early this year, McCarthy predicted to me that the new president would quickly subjugate the Freedom Caucus. \u201cTrump is strong in their districts,\u201d McCarthy told me. \u201cThere\u2019s not a place for them to survive in this world.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-32\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-19\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"678\" data-total-count=\"23913\" id=\"story-continues-19\">When we spoke on the morning of March 7, Trump assured me that he would not bully the Obamacare-replacement bill\u2019s loudest Republican critics, like the Freedom Caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, on Twitter: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to,\u201d he said. \u201cMark Meadows is a great guy and a friend of mine. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever disappoint me, or the party. I think he\u2019s great. No, I would never call him out on Twitter. Some of the others, too. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need to. Now, they\u2019re fighting for their turf, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be obstructionists. I spoke to Mark. He\u2019s got some ideas. I think they\u2019re very positive.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"763\" data-total-count=\"24676\">But on March 21, in a meeting with the Freedom Caucus about the bill, Trump called out Meadows by name, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to come after you, but I know I won\u2019t have to, because I know you\u2019ll vote \u2018yes.\u2019\u2009\u201d Meadows remained a \u201cno\u201d on the bill, and among conservatives, he was far from alone. One of the Freedom Caucus\u2019s most outspoken members, Representative Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho, believes that the Trump White House was led astray by Ryan\u2019s confidence that he knew what conservatives wanted when drafting the bill. \u201cThe legislation has to go through the body, not the top,\u201d Labrador told me. \u201cAnd if our leadership thinks now that we\u2019re a unified body, that they can do things while ignoring us, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"372\" data-total-count=\"25048\">Labrador is an affable but decidedly stubborn 49-year-old Mormon and former immigration lawyer who moved as a child with his single mother from Puerto Rico to Las Vegas. He was interviewed by the president-elect for the post of interior secretary at Trump Tower last December \u2014 though Trump selected Labrador\u2019s House colleague Ryan Zinke for the post a few days later.</p><div id=\"story-ad-5\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-20\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"542\" data-total-count=\"25590\" id=\"story-continues-20\">For now, Labrador and other Freedom Caucus members have been willing to blame House leaders like Ryan and McCarthy for drafting a health care bill that was not to conservatives\u2019 liking. They aspire to remain philosophical whenever Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka persuades her father to propose initiatives like paid family leave, as he did during his joint-session speech. \u201cI didn\u2019t stand up when he said that,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only part of the speech where I thought, That\u2019s not even close to what my party stands for.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-36\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-21\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"308\" data-total-count=\"25898\" id=\"story-continues-21\">To House conservatives like Labrador, the Republican Party stands for limited government. To Trump and Bannon, big-ticket items like a border wall and infrastructure take priority over shrinking America\u2019s debt. As Chaffetz admitted to me, \u201cOn the spending front, things could slip away really quickly.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1156\" data-total-count=\"27054\"><strong>Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/16/us/politics/document-Trump-2018-Budget.html\">budget blueprint</a> </strong>is regarded by deficit hawks as fundamentally unserious, because it does not touch entitlements. Instead, it ravages perennial (and already pint-size) conservative pi\u00f1atas like foreign aid, public broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts, in addition to downsizing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department \u2014 cuts that focus on the 27 percent of the federal budget that is not mandatory spending or devoted to defense. And for all the Republicans\u2019 chesty rhetoric on cuts like these over the years, as a top House Republican staff member told me, \u201ceven the cabinet secretaries at the E.P.A. and Interior are saying these cuts aren\u2019t going to happen. They\u2019re going to protect their grant programs, their payments to states, their Superfunds. So how do you cut 31 percent of the E.P.A. out of the 5 percent that isn\u2019t protected? And a bill that cuts all money for the N.E.A. will not pass. For Republicans in the West\u201d \u2014 states whose vast rural areas benefit disproportionately from N.E.A. grants \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s a re-election killer. The campaign commercials write themselves.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"646\" data-total-count=\"27700\">Labrador says he would defend Trump\u2019s cuts but doubts that many of his colleagues would. \u201cWhat he\u2019s going to learn is that members of Congress are unwilling to take the tough votes,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen he learns that, what\u2019s going to be the next step?\u201d In Labrador\u2019s view, Trump\u2019s only sane recourse will be to accept the need for entitlement reform. \u201cAt some point, the reality of the budget is going to have to hit him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have this economic nationalism \u2014 Bannon is very smart, he clearly helped him with his messaging, it was so successful \u2014 but at some point, that theory is going to hit reality.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"911\" data-total-count=\"28611\">When I spoke with Trump, I ventured that, based on available evidence, it seemed as though conservatives probably shouldn\u2019t hold their breath for the next four years expecting entitlement reform. Trump\u2019s reply was immediate. \u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. In fact, Trump seemed much less animated by the subject of budget cuts than the subject of spending increases. \u201cWe\u2019re also going to prime the pump,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I mean by \u2018prime the pump\u2019? In order to get this\u201d \u2014 the economy \u2014 \u201cgoing, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that\u2019ll be going, we\u2019re going to have to prime the pump to some extent. In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future.

Of course, Bannon has openly advocated abandoning the W.T.O. anyway, because of China\u2019s membership in it. Still, the specter of new taxes on American corporations, higher prices for consumers and a jump in the dollar\u2019s value may compel an unusual confederacy against the tax-reform plan.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-42\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-23\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"567\" data-total-count=\"30210\" id=\"story-continues-23\">Labrador predicts that the border-adjustment tax \u201cwill have very little political legs\u201d in the conservative House, while Senator Lindsey Graham <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/320306-graham-ryan-tax-plan-wont-get-10-votes-in-the-senate\">said in February</a> that even in the Republican-controlled Senate, Ryan\u2019s tax plan \u201cwon\u2019t get 10 votes.\u201d Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat who has been outspoken in her willingness to work with Trump in spite of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/magazine/democratic-party-election-trump.html\">broader stance of her party</a>, says, \u201cLet me tell you, I represent farmers, and anyone who tells me that farm country benefits from a high dollar needs to have a discussion with me.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad-6\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-24\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"533\" data-total-count=\"30743\" id=\"story-continues-24\">Perhaps the Republican faction most alarmed by Bannon\u2019s economic nationalism is Washington\u2019s military hawks.

McMaster, the national security adviser. \u201cWe discuss issues all the time. I think this is probably the finest national-security team that I\u2019ve ever observed. It\u2019s almost schizophrenic, in that I obviously don\u2019t have conversations with Steve Bannon, but I do with Reince Priebus \u2014 he was my Republican chair in Wisconsin in my 2008 presidential campaign. So it\u2019s almost a schizophrenic \u2014 that\u2019s not the right word. A very divided kind of relationship. Paradoxical.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"906\" data-total-count=\"32559\">McCain acknowledged to me that economic nationalism was a global movement and therefore not entirely \u201cthe making of some members of the Trump entourage.\u201d He then said: \u201cBut it is an articulation that I believe is strongly reminiscent of the 1930s. It certainly has unsettled our allies and friends around the world, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d Already, the senator asserted, the new administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/wall-border-trump.html\">bellicosity toward Mexico</a> has increased the likelihood that its citizens will elect \u201ca very left-wing, anti-American president.\u201d As for an import tax of the sort favored by Bannon and Ryan, \u201ctalk about harkening back to the 1930s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to me that they somehow think if we start taxing goods coming across the border, that that\u2019s somehow not going to be responded to by the Mexicans. Please. History shows this sort of action gets you into a trade war.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"392\" data-total-count=\"32951\"><strong>Listening to McCain\u2019s </strong>tirade, I found it evident that the Bannon Effect might well cost the Trump White House at least one Republican Senate vote on a number of central issues \u2014 this at a time when Republicans are clinging to a slender majority in the upper chamber. In such cases, Trump could find himself asking for something Obama was never able to count on: votes from the opposition.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"573\" data-total-count=\"33524\">Early in the afternoon of Feb. 9, several Democratic senators met with Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House to discuss the Gorsuch nomination and other matters. Among them were Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. All four are moderates who are up for re-election in 2018 in states Trump carried in 2016 by titanic margins \u2014 the least of which, in Donnelly\u2019s state, was nearly 20 points. If Democrats are to nurture any hopes of retaking the Senate majority, they will need to hold these four seats.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-48\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-26\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"703\" data-total-count=\"34227\" id=\"story-continues-26\">But if Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin and Tester need to be seen back home as willing to work with Trump, the president needs them as well. Republicans enjoy a precarious 52-to-48 advantage in the Senate. On matters like the Supreme Court, Trump can count on all 52. On votes requiring a simple majority, any two of those Republicans could fall away, and Pence could preserve the win with a tiebreaking vote. But a trio of fiscal hard-liners (like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Mike Lee), military hawks (John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio) or social moderates (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito) could deny Trump a majority, unless he could swing at least one Democrat to his side.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"498\" data-total-count=\"34725\">That February afternoon in the Roosevelt Room, Donnelly thanked Trump for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/business/economy/trump-carrier-pence-jobs.html\">negotiating with Carrier</a>, the manufacturing company based in Indiana that had threatened to move jobs to Mexico before Trump arm-twisted it into keeping many of them in Indiana. But Donnelly urged him not to view that episode as a \u201cone-off.\u201d He requested the president\u2019s support for his End Outsourcing Act, which would give preferential treatment in awarding federal contracts to businesses that kept jobs in America.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-50\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-27\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"563\" data-total-count=\"35288\" id=\"story-continues-27\">The words were scarcely out of Donnelly\u2019s mouth before Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent for that, and I\u2019ll do everything I can to help get it passed.\u201d He then asked Pence, who was in the room, \u201cWhat do you think, Mike?\u201d Trump was apparently unaware that Pence, as the governor of Donnelly\u2019s state, had refused to back the senator\u2019s initiative, claiming instead that burdensome federal regulations were to blame for outsourcing. According to Donnelly, Pence gamely replied, \u201cIf it\u2019s like what Joe describes, I\u2019ll do everything I can to help.\u201d</p><figure id=\"media-100000005008270\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000005008270 ratio-tall\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump4/02trump4-master675.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump4/02trump4-master675.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump4/02trump4-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"Representatives Ra&uacute;l Labrador, Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan at the Capitol on March 24.\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call, via Getty Images\"  itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump4/02trump4-master675.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"449\" />\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"675\" />\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n                <span class=\"caption-text\">Representatives Ra\u00fal Labrador, Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan at the Capitol on March 24.</span>\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\n            Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call, via Getty Images        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"633\" data-total-count=\"35921\">Donnelly, a thick-handed Irish Catholic with a barroom guffaw, had met Trump once before.

At a hotel conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the 20 or so Blue Dogs received a procession of guests, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President Bill Clinton. Only one of their scheduled appointments required that they go to their guest \u2014 and so they did, by bus, to Trump Tower.</p><div id=\"story-ad-7\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-28\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"392\" data-total-count=\"36313\" id=\"story-continues-28\">Trump greeted them in his boardroom, with its commanding view of Central Park. He was charming but also brash. \u201cRemember, at that point he wasn\u2019t really talking about running for office,\u201d recalls one attendee, former Representative Dan Boren of Oklahoma. \u201cBut what strikes me was how he talked about the same issues \u2014 the wall, China \u2014 that became his stump speech years later.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"707\" data-total-count=\"37020\">It was evident to the Blue Dogs that Trump was no Clinton or Bloomberg when it came to the issues. Says former Representative Ben Chandler of Kentucky, who was also in attendance: \u201cThe difference in terms of detailed knowledge of policy was stark. Trump just made bald assertions, really.\u201d Particularly memorable to Chandler was Trump\u2019s insistence \u201cthat one of the best things the country could do was slap a massive tariff on the Chinese.\u201d Chandler continued: \u201cHe seemed not to understand that this would probably cause the entire world economy to melt down by causing a huge trade war. What I remember more than anything else was our general reaction afterward. And it was one of disbelief.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-54\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-29\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"507\" data-total-count=\"37527\" id=\"story-continues-29\">Today Donnelly remains offended by what he calls Trump\u2019s \u201ccrazy stuff,\u201d as well as the alternative to Obamacare that Trump supported. But he does not begrudge Trump his showmanship. \u201cHe came to the Carrier plant,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on that issue since Day 1. I was begging people in the Obama administration to come out and talk to our workers. Donald Trump came out there. And Donald Trump talked to our workers. You can tell people you care. But it matters if you show up.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"746\" data-total-count=\"38273\">The Senate Democrat who, to outward appearances, seems closest to Trump is Joe Manchin, who met face to face with the president-elect in Trump Tower in December. Before the meeting, Bannon took the West Virginia senator aside. \u201cThe thing you need to know about Trump,\u201d Bannon said, \u201cis he doesn\u2019t care about the Republican Party and he doesn\u2019t care about the Democratic Party. He just wants to put some wins on the board for the country.\u201d In the meeting, Trump asked Manchin what could be done for coal miners. Manchin replied that he should support his Miners Protection Act, which would secure health benefits and pension funds for retired miners. According to Manchin, Trump replied that he would thoroughly support such a measure.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-56\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-30\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"617\" data-total-count=\"38890\" id=\"story-continues-30\">Later that month, Manchin went on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d \u2014 the one show on MSNBC that Trump has been known to watch \u2014 to discuss, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Newtown school massacre, the need to expand background checks on gun purchases. Within an hour after Manchin was offscreen, his cellphone rang. It was Trump. Manchin was not completely forthcoming about the conversation, but he did tell me that he envisioned \u201ca complete opportunity\u201d for new gun-safety legislation. Unlike with Obama, he said, \u201cno one thinks President Trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"720\" data-total-count=\"39610\">In his conversations with Manchin and Donnelly, Trump was essentially throwing his support behind a Democratic initiative without first checking with the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to ask what he thought of those proposals. Had he done so, the answer in each case would have been: not much. (Though on the coal miners\u2019 legislation, Manchin said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing Mitch McConnell go from a \u2018No, no and hell no\u2019 to now dropping his own bill. Which is fine, so long as we get it.\u201d) Still, Trump may have little choice but to indulge Democrats on some of their pet issues, given that he will need their votes on two of the most critical pieces of his agenda: infrastructure and trade deals.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"578\" data-total-count=\"40188\">Until now, Trump has divulged few details about this trillion-dollar infrastructure venture. On the campaign trail, he frequently cited America\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges. He bemoaned the potholes defiling the runways at La Guardia Airport, where he parked his two planes. During Donnelly\u2019s visit with Trump in the Roosevelt Room, the president \u201ctalked about the Queens-Midtown Tunnel with the tiles falling off, which he would see on his way to La Guardia,\u201d Donnelly recalled. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority denies that tiles are falling off the tunnel.)</p><div id=\"story-ad-8\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-31\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"386\" data-total-count=\"40574\" id=\"story-continues-31\">When I asked Trump for more specifics, he gingerly offered a few morsels: \u201cThis is something that\u2019s going to be a real infrastructure bill, where real work is going to be done on bridges and roads and airports and things that we\u2019re supposed to be doing. So it\u2019s not just a political piece of paper. We\u2019re going to do infrastructure, and it\u2019s going to be a very big thing.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-60\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-6 ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-32\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"439\" data-total-count=\"41013\" id=\"story-continues-32\">Trump\u2019s description struck me as uncharacteristically modest. Bannon had evoked a more gleaming vision when he told me: \u201cLook, economic nationalism is predicated on a state-of-the-art infrastructure for the country, right? Broadband as good as Korea. Airports as good as China. Roads as good as Germany. A rail system as good as France. If you\u2019re going to be a world-class power, you\u2019ve got to have a world-class infrastructure.\u201d</p><figure id=\"media-100000005008887\" class=\"media photo embedded layout-large-vertical media-100000005008887\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump7/02trump7-blog427.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Photo</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump7/02trump7-blog427.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump7/02trump7-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Christopher Anderson/Magnum, for The New York Times\"  itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump7/02trump7-blog427.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"569\" />\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"427\" />\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n                        <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n            <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span>\n            Christopher Anderson/Magnum, for The New York Times        </span>\n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"328\" data-total-count=\"41341\">When I asked the president if his initiative might include such features, he replied: \u201cYes. It could, it could. You look at Japan and China, where they have the fast trains, and we don\u2019t have any. You look at other countries where we used to be the leader, and now we\u2019re the laggard.

It\u2019s also possible that even moderate Democrats in swing states may face pressure not to come to Trump\u2019s rescue. After all, the president remains intensely unpopular among Democrats, who continue to nurture hopes that Trump is one Russia connection away from impeachment. As a senior White House official told me of Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court: \u201cThe comment we often get from Democrats is, \u2018That\u2019s a great nominee.\u2019 Oh, so you\u2019re voting for him? \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 Why not? \u2018My base would go crazy, and I\u2019d be primaried.\u2019 That environment has to change before we can have any of these conversations.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"951\" data-total-count=\"43112\"><strong>On the morning </strong>of Feb. 2, two Democratic leaders on trade issues, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts \u2014 the ranking members of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/trump-tax-imports.html\">met with Trump</a>, along with a few of his advisers and Republican lawmakers. Trump had already greeted the day by threatening to yank federal funding from the University of California at Berkeley after acts of violence had forced the cancellation of the Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s speech on campus, and by taunting Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s poor ratings on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d during the National Prayer Breakfast. Disquiet lingered from Trump\u2019s travel ban on refugees and his surly phone conversation with the Australian prime minister the previous week. Amid this chaos \u2014 entirely to Bannon\u2019s liking and grating to nearly everyone else in Washington \u2014 actual legislative activity was slowly unfolding.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-64\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 ad-aggro-8 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-33\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1097\" data-total-count=\"44209\" id=\"story-continues-33\">Trump began the meeting by condemning the trade deals negotiated by his predecessors. The press pool was then ushered out before the Democrats could say anything in front of the cameras. When Neal was given a chance to speak, he informed Trump, Pence, Bannon, Kushner and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that America had in fact prospered as a result of past trade deals. Neal emphasized the crucial role that the Panama Canal played in the economic vitality of the Eastern Seaboard. Other than Ross, no one on Trump\u2019s team seemed aware of this. \u201cThey were a bit surprised,\u201d Neal later told me. He was also struck by the White House\u2019s abhorrence of multilateral pacts, which seemed to him to be na\u00efve. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to negotiate 148 bilateral agreements with W.T.O. members does not seem realistic,\u201d Neal said. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re all of a sudden going to have a free-trade agreement with Great Britain, that\u2019s going to take years to do.\u201d Later, Neal said, Ross privately assured him that the Trump administration \u201cwould not give up on multilateral deals.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1219\" data-total-count=\"45428\">Neal\u2019s lecture signified the start of what is likely to be a long and at times contentious reckoning on the part of Trump and Bannon with the limits of their nationalist rhetoric. Of all the legislative lifts, none will be heavier than renegotiating trade agreements, which require fully two-thirds of the Senate. Scrounging up 15 Democratic senators who are willing to vote along with 52 Republicans would be a formidable enough task on any issue. But just as Democrats like Neal in the Northeast would fight for a trade deal that benefits their region, so will Republican lawmakers along the Southern border rebel at an effort to repeal Nafta. As McCain told me, \u201cIf you negated Nafta, it would send my state into a severe recession.\u201d He assured me that Trump\u2019s nationalist posture would not provoke only regional opposition. He conjured up another Republican era \u2014 not Reagan\u2019s, not Bush\u2019s, but instead that of Herbert Hoover, when two Republican lawmakers joined with a Republican president to design a protectionist initiative that ultimately caused American exports to plummet during the Great Depression. \u201cSomewhere,\u201d McCain said with a dark chuckle, \u201cMr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley are smiling.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-66\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-6 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-34\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"469\" data-total-count=\"45897\" id=\"story-continues-34\"><strong>On Thursday, March 23, </strong>Trump hosted a morning meeting of Freedom Caucus holdouts in the Cabinet Room. Jeff Duncan, a congressman from South Carolina who was present, told me that Trump told them: \u201cI need you guys. We need to put up a win. It\u2019s not just about needing to repeal Obamacare \u2014 though we do. It\u2019s also that a win here sets up a win for tax reform and gives us momentum going into infrastructure. And if the bill fails, it could derail all of that.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad-9\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent \">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-35\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"726\" data-total-count=\"46623\" id=\"story-continues-35\">With customary bravado, Trump told the conservative members that he didn\u2019t want to squeak by with just a one-vote victory. \u201cI want all 237 of you,\u201d he said, according to Duncan, referring to the entire House Republican conference. That included the more moderate members, who had told Trump they felt that the White House wasn\u2019t paying sufficient attention to their concerns. Later in the day, Trump hosted another meeting with the moderates, where Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania informed Trump that he remained a \u201cno.\u201d According to an attendee, Trump angrily informed Dent that he was \u201cdestroying the Republican Party\u201d and \u201cwas going to take down tax reform \u2014 and I\u2019m going to blame you.\u201d</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-68\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-4 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-36\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"552\" data-total-count=\"47175\" id=\"story-continues-36\">Until that day, Duncan had been an unyielding \u201cno\u201d on the bill. The previous week, he delivered an impassioned speech to the vice president and other Republicans, insisting that this vote constituted \u201cour generation\u2019s rendezvous with destiny \u2014 a real chance to roll back the size and scope of the federal government, returning some liberty back to the people through our actions to repeal Obamacare.\u201d In a text to me, Duncan pointed to history: \u201c39 men in a hot room in 1787 had the courage to break from the norm and empower a nation.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"422\" data-total-count=\"47597\">But now the four-term congressman was, for the first time in his life, sitting across the table from a president who was personally appealing for his support. The White House was offering concessions and agreeing to them in writing. Duncan left the meeting and spent a few hours pondering, as he would later put it, \u201cthe greater opportunity we as Republicans have.\u201d By that evening, Trump had won Jeff Duncan\u2019s vote.</p><button class=\"button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large\" data-skip-to-para-id=\"\">\n</button>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"152\" data-total-count=\"47749\">It wasn\u2019t enough. The next afternoon, Ryan <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/us/politics/health-care-affordable-care-act.html\">pulled the House health care bill</a>, conceding that neither he nor the White House could muster enough votes.</p><div id=\"story-ad--aggro-70\" class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent  ad-aggro-10 aggro-only\">\n    <div class=\"accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden\">\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n</div>\n<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-37\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"798\" data-total-count=\"48547\" id=\"story-continues-37\">\u201cYou get about nine months to do the big things,\u201d Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, told me at the beginning of the year. Nine months seemed like a long time then, the calendar spacious and the legislative deal-making possibilities plentiful. But more than two of those months are gone already \u2014 and the path to future wins, as Trump foresaw in his meeting with the Freedom Caucus, is now more complicated. When he took office, Trump relished the prospect of becoming a new kind of deal maker in the White House. By the time I spoke with him in early March, however, he already seemed to be taking stock of the limits to his powers. He still saw himself as the closer in chief \u2014 but then that was \u201ctypical, I would think, of a president,\u201d he mused. \u201cSome more than others.\u201d<span class=\"tombstone\"><i class=\"icon\"></i></span></p><footer class=\"story-footer story-content\">\n    <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                <div class=\"story-notes\"><p>Robert Draper is a writer at large for the magazine.

He is also approvingly seen as a fellow workaholic by the president (whose only known hobbies are golf and hate-watching CNN). And he is a deft operator who has learned from the successes and failures of other Trump advisers. He has carefully not claimed credit that the president would wish for himself and avoids giving expansive interviews on his own controversial views that might detract from his boss\u2019s celebrity. Like the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Bannon understands that power in Trump World derives mainly from close and sustained physical proximity to the boss. Unlike Lewandowski, Bannon immediately grasped the importance of maintaining close relations with Jared Kushner, who factored heavily in Lewandowski\u2019s dismissal from the Trump campaign last summer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut like Kushner, Bannon has never worked in government or at a policy-making institute and has no meaningful experience when it comes to getting legislation passed. On the Hill, he has a few random associations \u2014 Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative John Culberson of Texas among them. Otherwise, he remains a looming but indistinct presence to the lawmakers who will be needed to pass most of Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nBannon\u2019s interest in this agenda predated his association with Trump. One evening in January 2013, two guests showed up for dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that Bannon liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. One was the man Bannon would later describe to me as his \u201cmentor\u201d: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. The other was Sessions\u2019s top aide and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a jittery 27-year-old named Stephen Miller.\n\nTwo months earlier, Obama decisively defeated Mitt Romney in the presidential election, prompting Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to commission an analysis of the state of the party and its future, known colloquially in Washington as the \u201cautopsy,\u201d which would be delivered that spring. The only certainty was that the report would urge Republicans to court the growing Latino electorate \u2014 which had voted for Obama by a 44-point margin that November \u2014 by championing comprehensive immigration reform. The three men at the dinner table that night were among the few Republicans in town who thoroughly rejected that conclusion.\n\nBannon wanted to talk to Sessions and Miller about a different report: an article written by Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst for the website RealClearPolitics, titled \u201cThe Case of the Missing White Voters.\u201d Trende observed that Obama\u2019s victory was less a function of increased minority turnout than of the fact that 6.6 million white voters who participated in the 2008 election stayed home in 2012. The reason for this drop, Trende argued, was that white working-class voters who did not approve of Obama but were alienated by Romney\u2019s perceived elitism had not voted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese votes were gettable, Bannon believed. As he would later tell me: \u201cThe working class, and in particular the lower middle class, understands something that\u2019s so obvious \u2014 which is that they\u2019ve basically underwritten the rise of China. Their jobs, their raises, their retirement accounts have all fueled the private equity and venture capital that built China. Because China\u2019s really built on investments and exports, right? People are smart enough to know that they\u2019re getting played by both political parties. The two may be different on social issues, but when it comes to fundamental economics, they\u2019re both the same. That\u2019s why the American working class is interested in trade. It\u2019s linked to their lives.\u201d\n\nSessions shared Bannon\u2019s belief that the Republican Party needed to emphasize immigration reduction, border security and the preservation of working-class jobs through trade policy rather than courting Latino voters with a bill he regarded as \u201camnesty.\u201d As Sessions would write in a memorandum to his Republican colleagues six months later, \u201cThis humble and honest populism \u2014 in contrast to the administration\u2019s cheap demagoguery \u2014 would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt some point during the five-hour dinner, Bannon recalls blurting out to Sessions, \u201cWe have to run you for president.\u201d Just two years earlier, in 2011, he made a similar pitch to Sarah Palin, after completing a documentary about her called \u201cThe Undefeated.\u201d Palin demurred. She was enjoying her life of celebrity and wealth, she had done little to immerse herself in policy minutiae and she was no doubt unsettled by Bannon\u2019s warning that she stood little chance of defeating Obama.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow he delivered a similar message to Sessions. \u201cLook, you\u2019re not going to win,\u201d he recalls saying. \u201cBut you can get the Republican nomination. And once you control the apparatus, you can make fundamental changes. Trade is No.100 on the party\u2019s list. You can make it No.1. Immigration is No.10. We can make it No.2.\u201d Acknowledging that the drawling Alabama senator lacked Palin\u2019s charisma, Bannon said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be the anti-candidate.\u201d But Sessions told Bannon he did not see himself running for president. \u201cIt was pretty obvious by the end of the night,\u201d Bannon recalled, \u201cthat another candidate would have to do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo months later, on March 15, 2013, Bannon happened to be attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when Trump took the stage. Trump had been a marginal figure at most in politics up to that point, entertaining a Reform Party run in the 2000 election \u2014 when he speculated that he would probably take more votes from the Democratic candidate than the Republican one \u2014 and leading a conspiratorial crusade in 2011 to force Obama to release his birth certificate. The possibility that he might be a suitable host body for Bannon\u2019s worldview had not occurred to Bannon before Trump spoke.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Trump\u2019s grousing references to China\u2019s economic superiority, to 11 million \u201cillegals\u201d and to the erosion of America\u2019s manufacturing sector were right out of Bannon\u2019s playbook. From his desk in the Russell Senate Office Building, Stephen Miller, too, watched Trump\u2019s speech. By 2014, Miller was sending emails to friends expressing the hope that Trump would run for president. By the time Trump announced his candidacy, in June 2015, Sessions was officially uncommitted but privately of the view that Trump was best suited to tap into the movement that he, Miller and Bannon discussed over dinner more than two years earlier.\n\nBannon\u2019s early support for Trump was manifest in Breitbart\u2019s breathless coverage of his candidacy. In an email he sent on Aug. 30, 2015, to his former filmmaking partner Julia Jones, Bannon explained that while Republican candidates like Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina were \u201call great,\u201d Trump represented a superior choice, because he \u201cis a nationalist who embraces Senator Sessions\u2019s plan\u201d on immigration. Still, recalls Sam Nunberg, Trump\u2019s first campaign strategist, \u201cSteve kept all of his cards.\u201d He added: \u201cHe was respectful to some of the other ones who were running, like Walker and Cruz and Carson. He didn\u2019t want to be seen as Trump-bart.\u201d When Trump publicly disparaged John McCain\u2019s war-hero credentials, Bannon \u2014 himself a Navy veteran \u2014 called Nunberg and demanded that Trump issue an apology. (Trump did not.)\n\nBannon was well positioned as a supportive but not sycophantic observer by Aug. 13, 2016, when the Trump donor Rebekah Mercer read with alarm a New York Times account of the Trump campaign\u2019s inability to handle its mercurial candidate. At Mercer\u2019s behest, Bannon (whose website Mercer\u2019s family helped underwrite) and Kellyanne Conway (who at that point was receiving money from both a Mercer family political action committee and the Trump campaign) flew out that day to East Hampton, N.Y., where Trump was attending a dinner fund-raiser at the home of the New York Jets\u2019 owner, Woody Johnson. After the dinner, Bannon and Conway huddled with the candidate. Bannon remembers telling Trump, who at the time was trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits in the polls, \u201cAs long as you stick to the message\u201d \u2014 by which he meant economic nationalism \u2014 \u201cyou have a 100 percent probability of winning.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA week after the election, in an interview with the journalist Michael Wolff, Bannon offered a bold, sweeping sketch of what the vision might mean in policy terms: \u201cLike [Andrew] Jackson\u2019s populism, we\u2019re going to build an entirely new political movement. It\u2019s everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy.\u201d Of course, some of the conservatives Bannon intended to drive crazy possessed the congressional votes Bannon and Trump would need to advance this agenda. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a leading conservative in the House, told me in March, \u201cI would argue that populism, as long as it\u2019s rooted in conservative principle, is a darn good thing.\u201d Jordan was smiling as he said it, but the note of warning was hard to mistake.\n\nThe last time the Republican Party controlled all branches of government in Washington was from 2003 to 2007. During that period, the United States military toppled Saddam Hussein, Congress delivered tax cuts for the wealthy and President George W. Bush appointed the reliably conservative jurist Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut in the collective view of conservatives, these years of the Bush presidency were mostly characterized by betrayal and disappointment. Goaded by Bush, congressional Republicans passed into law a new federal entitlement (prescription drugs for senior citizens, also known as Medicare Part D), ran up the deficit, promoted democratic ideals overseas in the feckless manner of Woodrow Wilson, considered a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and confirmed a Supreme Court chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr., whose swing vote would later save Obamacare from judicial evisceration. \u201cMy go-to line when I first ran in 2008 was, \u2018Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House \u2014 and they blew it,\u2019 \u201d Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told me. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got all three again, and I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s in Congress, not running for it. I don\u2019t want to be in a position where we\u2019re going to blow it one more time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChaffetz and other House conservatives freely acknowledge that Trump is not cut from their cloth, but they say they could not care less as long as he gives them what they want. Selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia was \u201cthe best thing the president did in his first 50 days,\u201d Chaffetz told me. He and his conservative colleagues have been cheered by Trump\u2019s recruitment of former House colleagues and conservative stalwarts like Vice President Mike Pence; Tom Price, the health and human services secretary; and Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Chaffetz and I spoke in March, he had met with the president twice so far \u2014 access he considered \u201csuch a huge sea change\u201d from the stony silence Republicans say they encountered from the Obama White House. Most important, the Trump agenda\u2019s first three projected legislative moves \u2014 the Obamacare repeal and replacement, an austere budget and tax reform \u2014 were intended to keep conservatives happily in Trump\u2019s camp. In turn, when the agenda moved on to less conservative items like infrastructure and trade agreements, Trump and Bannon would fully expect Republicans, including Ryan, to remember whose message resonated most with working-class voters last year.\n\nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, is Trump\u2019s chief point of contact on the Hill. When McCarthy was a college student and budding entrepreneur in Bakersfield, Calif., in the late 1980s, his girlfriend at the time, now his wife, Judy, gave him an autographed copy of Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cI thought it was great,\u201d he told me. In McCarthy\u2019s view, Trump is a master of today\u2019s media, much as Lincoln and Kennedy were in their own times. \u201cHe\u2019s mastered instantaneous Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like owning newspapers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump has found a kindred spirit in McCarthy, a coastal extrovert of ambiguous ideological portfolio who (unlike Ryan) would far rather talk about personalities than the tax code. And as the former minority leader in the California Legislature during the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger, McCarthy is experienced in the care and feeding of celebrity egos. Since Trump\u2019s nomination, the two have spoken frequently by phone \u2014 to date, Trump has never been known to directly email or text anyone \u2014 about the cast of 535 characters with whom the president must now deal.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut in the end, what Trump needs from the majority leader is not gossip but votes \u2014 216 of them, to be exact, in the House. And McCarthy\u2019s recent track record in obtaining majorities has not been the greatest. In his previous capacity as House whip, he was thwarted by members of his own party when it came to subjects as diverse as reauthorizing a Patriot Act they deemed too intrusive, a farm bill they considered too expensive and a border-security bill they regarded as too lenient. His most reliable obstacles have been the three dozen or so House conservatives known as the Freedom Caucus, a two-year-old group of fiscal hard-liners. Early this year, McCarthy predicted to me that the new president would quickly subjugate the Freedom Caucus. \u201cTrump is strong in their districts,\u201d McCarthy told me. \u201cThere\u2019s not a place for them to survive in this world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen we spoke on the morning of March 7, Trump assured me that he would not bully the Obamacare-replacement bill\u2019s loudest Republican critics, like the Freedom Caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, on Twitter: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to,\u201d he said. \u201cMark Meadows is a great guy and a friend of mine. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever disappoint me, or the party. I think he\u2019s great. No, I would never call him out on Twitter. Some of the others, too. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need to. Now, they\u2019re fighting for their turf, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be obstructionists. I spoke to Mark. He\u2019s got some ideas. I think they\u2019re very positive.\u201d\n\nBut on March 21, in a meeting with the Freedom Caucus about the bill, Trump called out Meadows by name, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to come after you, but I know I won\u2019t have to, because I know you\u2019ll vote \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d Meadows remained a \u201cno\u201d on the bill, and among conservatives, he was far from alone. One of the Freedom Caucus\u2019s most outspoken members, Representative Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho, believes that the Trump White House was led astray by Ryan\u2019s confidence that he knew what conservatives wanted when drafting the bill. \u201cThe legislation has to go through the body, not the top,\u201d Labrador told me. \u201cAnd if our leadership thinks now that we\u2019re a unified body, that they can do things while ignoring us, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nLabrador is an affable but decidedly stubborn 49-year-old Mormon and former immigration lawyer who moved as a child with his single mother from Puerto Rico to Las Vegas. He was interviewed by the president-elect for the post of interior secretary at Trump Tower last December \u2014 though Trump selected Labrador\u2019s House colleague Ryan Zinke for the post a few days later.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor now, Labrador and other Freedom Caucus members have been willing to blame House leaders like Ryan and McCarthy for drafting a health care bill that was not to conservatives\u2019 liking. They aspire to remain philosophical whenever Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka persuades her father to propose initiatives like paid family leave, as he did during his joint-session speech. \u201cI didn\u2019t stand up when he said that,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only part of the speech where I thought, That\u2019s not even close to what my party stands for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo House conservatives like Labrador, the Republican Party stands for limited government. To Trump and Bannon, big-ticket items like a border wall and infrastructure take priority over shrinking America\u2019s debt. As Chaffetz admitted to me, \u201cOn the spending front, things could slip away really quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s budget blueprint is regarded by deficit hawks as fundamentally unserious, because it does not touch entitlements. Instead, it ravages perennial (and already pint-size) conservative pi\u00f1atas like foreign aid, public broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts, in addition to downsizing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department \u2014 cuts that focus on the 27 percent of the federal budget that is not mandatory spending or devoted to defense. And for all the Republicans\u2019 chesty rhetoric on cuts like these over the years, as a top House Republican staff member told me, \u201ceven the cabinet secretaries at the E.P.A. and Interior are saying these cuts aren\u2019t going to happen. They\u2019re going to protect their grant programs, their payments to states, their Superfunds. So how do you cut 31 percent of the E.P.A. out of the 5 percent that isn\u2019t protected? And a bill that cuts all money for the N.E.A. will not pass. For Republicans in the West\u201d \u2014 states whose vast rural areas benefit disproportionately from N.E.A. grants \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s a re-election killer. The campaign commercials write themselves.\u201d\n\nLabrador says he would defend Trump\u2019s cuts but doubts that many of his colleagues would. \u201cWhat he\u2019s going to learn is that members of Congress are unwilling to take the tough votes,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen he learns that, what\u2019s going to be the next step?\u201d In Labrador\u2019s view, Trump\u2019s only sane recourse will be to accept the need for entitlement reform. \u201cAt some point, the reality of the budget is going to have to hit him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have this economic nationalism \u2014 Bannon is very smart, he clearly helped him with his messaging, it was so successful \u2014 but at some point, that theory is going to hit reality.\u201d\n\nWhen I spoke with Trump, I ventured that, based on available evidence, it seemed as though conservatives probably shouldn\u2019t hold their breath for the next four years expecting entitlement reform. Trump\u2019s reply was immediate. \u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. In fact, Trump seemed much less animated by the subject of budget cuts than the subject of spending increases. \u201cWe\u2019re also going to prime the pump,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what I mean by \u2018prime the pump\u2019? In order to get this\u201d \u2014 the economy \u2014 \u201cgoing, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that\u2019ll be going, we\u2019re going to have to prime the pump to some extent. In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future. And that\u2019ll happen.\u201d A clearer elucidation of Keynesian liberalism could not have been delivered by Obama.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe one clear point of agreement between the Trump economic nationalists and the House conservatives is the one Ryan and Bannon identified over dinner in January: tax reform. But in so doing, they will be picking a fight that may prove perilous to Republicans. The border-adjustment-tax proposal that Ryan floated to Bannon has never been able to get past K Street lobbyists and wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen I asked Trump if he was a fan of the border-adjustment tax, he replied: \u201cI am. I\u2019m the king of that.\u201d Almost no other country grafts an import tax onto a corporate tax, and it\u2019s possible that enacting a border-adjustment tax might well be in violation of the World Trade Organization\u2019s agreements. Of course, Bannon has openly advocated abandoning the W.T.O. anyway, because of China\u2019s membership in it. Still, the specter of new taxes on American corporations, higher prices for consumers and a jump in the dollar\u2019s value may compel an unusual confederacy against the tax-reform plan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLabrador predicts that the border-adjustment tax \u201cwill have very little political legs\u201d in the conservative House, while Senator Lindsey Graham said in February that even in the Republican-controlled Senate, Ryan\u2019s tax plan \u201cwon\u2019t get 10 votes.\u201d Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat who has been outspoken in her willingness to work with Trump in spite of the broader stance of her party, says, \u201cLet me tell you, I represent farmers, and anyone who tells me that farm country benefits from a high dollar needs to have a discussion with me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerhaps the Republican faction most alarmed by Bannon\u2019s economic nationalism is Washington\u2019s military hawks. John McCain is among those not mollified by Trump\u2019s pledge of enacting \u201cone of the largest increases in national-defense spending in American history.\u201d McCain scoffed when I brought this up to him. \u201cOf course that\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look at 1981 and Reagan\u2019s commitment to rebuilding the military, there\u2019s no comparison to this 3 percent increase. It\u2019s a shell game, my friend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite his obvious differences with Trump, McCain was willing to work with him \u2014 but Bannon\u2019s presence seemed to confound such prospects. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting,\u201d McCain said, \u201cbecause I have decades of experience with Kelly, with Mattis, with Dan Coats, McMaster,\u201d referring to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly; Defense Secretary James Mattis; Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence; and H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. \u201cWe discuss issues all the time. I think this is probably the finest national-security team that I\u2019ve ever observed. It\u2019s almost schizophrenic, in that I obviously don\u2019t have conversations with Steve Bannon, but I do with Reince Priebus \u2014 he was my Republican chair in Wisconsin in my 2008 presidential campaign. So it\u2019s almost a schizophrenic \u2014 that\u2019s not the right word. A very divided kind of relationship. Paradoxical.\u201d\n\nMcCain acknowledged to me that economic nationalism was a global movement and therefore not entirely \u201cthe making of some members of the Trump entourage.\u201d He then said: \u201cBut it is an articulation that I believe is strongly reminiscent of the 1930s. It certainly has unsettled our allies and friends around the world, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d Already, the senator asserted, the new administration\u2019s bellicosity toward Mexico has increased the likelihood that its citizens will elect \u201ca very left-wing, anti-American president.\u201d As for an import tax of the sort favored by Bannon and Ryan, \u201ctalk about harkening back to the 1930s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to me that they somehow think if we start taxing goods coming across the border, that that\u2019s somehow not going to be responded to by the Mexicans. Please. History shows this sort of action gets you into a trade war.\u201d\n\nListening to McCain\u2019s tirade, I found it evident that the Bannon Effect might well cost the Trump White House at least one Republican Senate vote on a number of central issues \u2014 this at a time when Republicans are clinging to a slender majority in the upper chamber. In such cases, Trump could find himself asking for something Obama was never able to count on: votes from the opposition.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Feb. 9, several Democratic senators met with Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House to discuss the Gorsuch nomination and other matters. Among them were Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. All four are moderates who are up for re-election in 2018 in states Trump carried in 2016 by titanic margins \u2014 the least of which, in Donnelly\u2019s state, was nearly 20 points. If Democrats are to nurture any hopes of retaking the Senate majority, they will need to hold these four seats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut if Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin and Tester need to be seen back home as willing to work with Trump, the president needs them as well. Republicans enjoy a precarious 52-to-48 advantage in the Senate. On matters like the Supreme Court, Trump can count on all 52. On votes requiring a simple majority, any two of those Republicans could fall away, and Pence could preserve the win with a tiebreaking vote. But a trio of fiscal hard-liners (like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Mike Lee), military hawks (John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio) or social moderates (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito) could deny Trump a majority, unless he could swing at least one Democrat to his side.\n\nThat February afternoon in the Roosevelt Room, Donnelly thanked Trump for negotiating with Carrier, the manufacturing company based in Indiana that had threatened to move jobs to Mexico before Trump arm-twisted it into keeping many of them in Indiana. But Donnelly urged him not to view that episode as a \u201cone-off.\u201d He requested the president\u2019s support for his End Outsourcing Act, which would give preferential treatment in awarding federal contracts to businesses that kept jobs in America.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe words were scarcely out of Donnelly\u2019s mouth before Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent for that, and I\u2019ll do everything I can to help get it passed.\u201d He then asked Pence, who was in the room, \u201cWhat do you think, Mike?\u201d Trump was apparently unaware that Pence, as the governor of Donnelly\u2019s state, had refused to back the senator\u2019s initiative, claiming instead that burdensome federal regulations were to blame for outsourcing. According to Donnelly, Pence gamely replied, \u201cIf it\u2019s like what Joe describes, I\u2019ll do everything I can to help.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDonnelly, a thick-handed Irish Catholic with a barroom guffaw, had met Trump once before. In January 2011, he was among the so-called Blue Dog Coalition, composed of conservative House Democrats \u2014 what remained of them, anyway, after the previous November\u2019s disastrous midterms \u2014 who traveled to New York for their annual retreat. At a hotel conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the 20 or so Blue Dogs received a procession of guests, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President Bill Clinton. Only one of their scheduled appointments required that they go to their guest \u2014 and so they did, by bus, to Trump Tower.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump greeted them in his boardroom, with its commanding view of Central Park. He was charming but also brash. \u201cRemember, at that point he wasn\u2019t really talking about running for office,\u201d recalls one attendee, former Representative Dan Boren of Oklahoma. \u201cBut what strikes me was how he talked about the same issues \u2014 the wall, China \u2014 that became his stump speech years later.\u201d\n\nIt was evident to the Blue Dogs that Trump was no Clinton or Bloomberg when it came to the issues. Says former Representative Ben Chandler of Kentucky, who was also in attendance: \u201cThe difference in terms of detailed knowledge of policy was stark. Trump just made bald assertions, really.\u201d Particularly memorable to Chandler was Trump\u2019s insistence \u201cthat one of the best things the country could do was slap a massive tariff on the Chinese.\u201d Chandler continued: \u201cHe seemed not to understand that this would probably cause the entire world economy to melt down by causing a huge trade war. What I remember more than anything else was our general reaction afterward. And it was one of disbelief.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToday Donnelly remains offended by what he calls Trump\u2019s \u201ccrazy stuff,\u201d as well as the alternative to Obamacare that Trump supported. But he does not begrudge Trump his showmanship. \u201cHe came to the Carrier plant,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on that issue since Day 1. I was begging people in the Obama administration to come out and talk to our workers. Donald Trump came out there. And Donald Trump talked to our workers. You can tell people you care. But it matters if you show up.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Democrat who, to outward appearances, seems closest to Trump is Joe Manchin, who met face to face with the president-elect in Trump Tower in December. Before the meeting, Bannon took the West Virginia senator aside. \u201cThe thing you need to know about Trump,\u201d Bannon said, \u201cis he doesn\u2019t care about the Republican Party and he doesn\u2019t care about the Democratic Party. He just wants to put some wins on the board for the country.\u201d In the meeting, Trump asked Manchin what could be done for coal miners. Manchin replied that he should support his Miners Protection Act, which would secure health benefits and pension funds for retired miners. According to Manchin, Trump replied that he would thoroughly support such a measure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLater that month, Manchin went on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d \u2014 the one show on MSNBC that Trump has been known to watch \u2014 to discuss, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Newtown school massacre, the need to expand background checks on gun purchases. Within an hour after Manchin was offscreen, his cellphone rang. It was Trump. Manchin was not completely forthcoming about the conversation, but he did tell me that he envisioned \u201ca complete opportunity\u201d for new gun-safety legislation. Unlike with Obama, he said, \u201cno one thinks President Trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights.\u201d\n\nIn his conversations with Manchin and Donnelly, Trump was essentially throwing his support behind a Democratic initiative without first checking with the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to ask what he thought of those proposals. Had he done so, the answer in each case would have been: not much. (Though on the coal miners\u2019 legislation, Manchin said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing Mitch McConnell go from a \u2018No, no and hell no\u2019 to now dropping his own bill. Which is fine, so long as we get it.\u201d) Still, Trump may have little choice but to indulge Democrats on some of their pet issues, given that he will need their votes on two of the most critical pieces of his agenda: infrastructure and trade deals.\n\nUntil now, Trump has divulged few details about this trillion-dollar infrastructure venture. On the campaign trail, he frequently cited America\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges. He bemoaned the potholes defiling the runways at La Guardia Airport, where he parked his two planes. During Donnelly\u2019s visit with Trump in the Roosevelt Room, the president \u201ctalked about the Queens-Midtown Tunnel with the tiles falling off, which he would see on his way to La Guardia,\u201d Donnelly recalled. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority denies that tiles are falling off the tunnel.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I asked Trump for more specifics, he gingerly offered a few morsels: \u201cThis is something that\u2019s going to be a real infrastructure bill, where real work is going to be done on bridges and roads and airports and things that we\u2019re supposed to be doing. So it\u2019s not just a political piece of paper. We\u2019re going to do infrastructure, and it\u2019s going to be a very big thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump\u2019s description struck me as uncharacteristically modest. Bannon had evoked a more gleaming vision when he told me: \u201cLook, economic nationalism is predicated on a state-of-the-art infrastructure for the country, right? Broadband as good as Korea. Airports as good as China. Roads as good as Germany. A rail system as good as France. If you\u2019re going to be a world-class power, you\u2019ve got to have a world-class infrastructure.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen I asked the president if his initiative might include such features, he replied: \u201cYes. It could, it could. You look at Japan and China, where they have the fast trains, and we don\u2019t have any. You look at other countries where we used to be the leader, and now we\u2019re the laggard. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore.\u201d\n\nWhat also may not happen is House Republicans\u2019 supporting a trillion-dollar bill that is at least somewhat reminiscent of the stimulus bill they unanimously opposed eight years ago. It\u2019s also possible that even moderate Democrats in swing states may face pressure not to come to Trump\u2019s rescue. After all, the president remains intensely unpopular among Democrats, who continue to nurture hopes that Trump is one Russia connection away from impeachment. As a senior White House official told me of Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court: \u201cThe comment we often get from Democrats is, \u2018That\u2019s a great nominee.\u2019 Oh, so you\u2019re voting for him? \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 Why not? \u2018My base would go crazy, and I\u2019d be primaried.\u2019 That environment has to change before we can have any of these conversations.\u201d\n\nOn the morning of Feb. 2, two Democratic leaders on trade issues, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts \u2014 the ranking members of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees \u2014 met with Trump, along with a few of his advisers and Republican lawmakers. Trump had already greeted the day by threatening to yank federal funding from the University of California at Berkeley after acts of violence had forced the cancellation of the Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s speech on campus, and by taunting Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s poor ratings on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d during the National Prayer Breakfast. Disquiet lingered from Trump\u2019s travel ban on refugees and his surly phone conversation with the Australian prime minister the previous week. Amid this chaos \u2014 entirely to Bannon\u2019s liking and grating to nearly everyone else in Washington \u2014 actual legislative activity was slowly unfolding.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrump began the meeting by condemning the trade deals negotiated by his predecessors. The press pool was then ushered out before the Democrats could say anything in front of the cameras. When Neal was given a chance to speak, he informed Trump, Pence, Bannon, Kushner and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that America had in fact prospered as a result of past trade deals. Neal emphasized the crucial role that the Panama Canal played in the economic vitality of the Eastern Seaboard. Other than Ross, no one on Trump\u2019s team seemed aware of this. \u201cThey were a bit surprised,\u201d Neal later told me. He was also struck by the White House\u2019s abhorrence of multilateral pacts, which seemed to him to be na\u00efve. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to negotiate 148 bilateral agreements with W.T.O. members does not seem realistic,\u201d Neal said. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re all of a sudden going to have a free-trade agreement with Great Britain, that\u2019s going to take years to do.\u201d Later, Neal said, Ross privately assured him that the Trump administration \u201cwould not give up on multilateral deals.\u201d\n\nNeal\u2019s lecture signified the start of what is likely to be a long and at times contentious reckoning on the part of Trump and Bannon with the limits of their nationalist rhetoric. Of all the legislative lifts, none will be heavier than renegotiating trade agreements, which require fully two-thirds of the Senate. Scrounging up 15 Democratic senators who are willing to vote along with 52 Republicans would be a formidable enough task on any issue. But just as Democrats like Neal in the Northeast would fight for a trade deal that benefits their region, so will Republican lawmakers along the Southern border rebel at an effort to repeal Nafta. As McCain told me, \u201cIf you negated Nafta, it would send my state into a severe recession.\u201d He assured me that Trump\u2019s nationalist posture would not provoke only regional opposition. He conjured up another Republican era \u2014 not Reagan\u2019s, not Bush\u2019s, but instead that of Herbert Hoover, when two Republican lawmakers joined with a Republican president to design a protectionist initiative that ultimately caused American exports to plummet during the Great Depression. \u201cSomewhere,\u201d McCain said with a dark chuckle, \u201cMr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley are smiling.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday, March 23, Trump hosted a morning meeting of Freedom Caucus holdouts in the Cabinet Room. Jeff Duncan, a congressman from South Carolina who was present, told me that Trump told them: \u201cI need you guys. We need to put up a win. It\u2019s not just about needing to repeal Obamacare \u2014 though we do. It\u2019s also that a win here sets up a win for tax reform and gives us momentum going into infrastructure. And if the bill fails, it could derail all of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith customary bravado, Trump told the conservative members that he didn\u2019t want to squeak by with just a one-vote victory. \u201cI want all 237 of you,\u201d he said, according to Duncan, referring to the entire House Republican conference. That included the more moderate members, who had told Trump they felt that the White House wasn\u2019t paying sufficient attention to their concerns. Later in the day, Trump hosted another meeting with the moderates, where Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania informed Trump that he remained a \u201cno.\u201d According to an attendee, Trump angrily informed Dent that he was \u201cdestroying the Republican Party\u201d and \u201cwas going to take down tax reform \u2014 and I\u2019m going to blame you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUntil that day, Duncan had been an unyielding \u201cno\u201d on the bill. The previous week, he delivered an impassioned speech to the vice president and other Republicans, insisting that this vote constituted \u201cour generation\u2019s rendezvous with destiny \u2014 a real chance to roll back the size and scope of the federal government, returning some liberty back to the people through our actions to repeal Obamacare.\u201d In a text to me, Duncan pointed to history: \u201c39 men in a hot room in 1787 had the courage to break from the norm and empower a nation.\u201d\n\nBut now the four-term congressman was, for the first time in his life, sitting across the table from a president who was personally appealing for his support. The White House was offering concessions and agreeing to them in writing. Duncan left the meeting and spent a few hours pondering, as he would later put it, \u201cthe greater opportunity we as Republicans have.\u201d By that evening, Trump had won Jeff Duncan\u2019s vote.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough. The next afternoon, Ryan pulled the House health care bill, conceding that neither he nor the White House could muster enough votes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou get about nine months to do the big things,\u201d Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, told me at the beginning of the year. Nine months seemed like a long time then, the calendar spacious and the legislative deal-making possibilities plentiful. But more than two of those months are gone already \u2014 and the path to future wins, as Trump foresaw in his meeting with the Freedom Caucus, is now more complicated. When he took office, Trump relished the prospect of becoming a new kind of deal maker in the White House. By the time I spoke with him in early March, however, he already seemed to be taking stock of the limits to his powers. He still saw himself as the closer in chief \u2014 but then that was \u201ctypical, I would think, of a president,\u201d he mused. \u201cSome more than others.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/19/magazine/19cover/19cover-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/25/us/25trump-republicans-3/25trump-republicans-3-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump2/02trump2-master675.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump5/02thrump5-master675.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump4/02trump4-master675.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump1/02trump1-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump3/02trump3-master675.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump6/02trump6-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump7/02trump7-blog427.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/magazine/02trump6/02trump6-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"], "videos": []}
