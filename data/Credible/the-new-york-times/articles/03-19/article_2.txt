They were taken during a hunting trip in 2010 arranged by <a href=\"http://huntinglegends.co.za/trump-brothers-hunt-legal/\">Hunting Legends International</a>, a safari company based in Pretoria, South Africa.

Given that he is a skilled outdoorsman and a member of the National Rifle Association who owns dozens of firearms, among them a Benelli Super Black Eagle II (for hunting waterfowl) and an AR-platform semiautomatic rifle (for marksmanship competitions), Mr. Trump also connects with heartland voters in a way that his more refined sister Ivanka may not.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, have lately elevated their social profile in Washington and Palm Beach, Fla., while keeping close contact with the president, her oldest brother has largely avoided the balls and benefits, preferring to hunker down in Midtown during the workweek and spend weekends in the Catskills with his wife, Vanessa, and their five children.\n\n\u201cDon is the more chill version of any of the kids,\u201d said Dee Dee Sides, who has known him since the early 2000s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe came into his own as a public figure during the presidential campaign. On the stump he was equally at ease before crowds in both Mississippi and Michigan, and television pundits gushed about his political future after his bluntly effective speech at the Republican National Convention, with some mentioning him as a potential mayoral candidate in New York City.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could go all-in at that,\u201d Mr. Trump said of a political career. \u201cThere is a part that is incredibly enticing. But it\u2019s not human most of the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven as he embraces his new status in business and politics, Mr. Trump sounds, at times, as if it is some kind of anomaly.\n\n\u201cIf I could miracle myself away,\u201d he said, \u201cI would live out West.\u201d\n\nInto the Woods\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s friendships are rooted, for the most part, in hunting and fishing, sports that do not appeal to the golf-loving patriarch of the Trump family. He said he decided early on not to measure himself against his father.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think people are often surprised, but I never defined myself as, \u2018I\u2019m the business guy who has to supersede what my father has done,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a totally unique individual. Somehow having to top his accomplishments is never the way I perceived things.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe developed a distaste for living in public at an early age. In 1990, his father separated from his mother, Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech model and skier, after having an affair with the model and sometime actress Marla Maples. Donald Jr. was 12 at a time when gossip columnists, some encouraged by his father, chronicled the family soap opera. During this time, Donald Jr. did not speak to his father for a year, New York magazine reported in 2004 in an article about the Trump children.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore the divorce, Mr. Trump found a role model in someone quite different from his father: his maternal grandfather, Milos Zelnicek, an electrician who was an avid outdoorsman. In the summers, he stayed at the Zelniceks\u2019 home in a town near Prague for six to eight weeks at a time, and his grandfather schooled him in camping, fishing, hunting and the Czech language.\n\n\u201cHe needed a father figure,\u201d his mother said in a telephone interview. \u201cDonald was not around that much. They would have to go to his office to say hello to him before going to school.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Zelnicek, who died in 1990, allowed his grandson a freedom not readily available to a child of Fifth Avenue. As Mr. Trump put it: \u201cHe said: \u2018There is the woods. See you at dark.\u2019 I think I felt a little trapped in New York City.\u201d\n\nDespite the advantages of wealth, Mr. Trump said his life at home was not always easy. \u201cIn our family, if you weren\u2019t competitive you didn\u2019t eat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had to fight for what you wanted.\u201d\n\nHis mother recalled walking into the breakfast room one morning and noticing that the chandelier was broken: \u201cIvanka said it was Don Jr. So I put him over my knee and spanked him. He said, \u2018Mom, it wasn\u2019t me!\u2019\u201d\n\nIt turned out that Ivanka lied, the former Mrs. Trump said.\n\nThe divorce was made final in 1992, and Mr. Trump\u2019s father married Ms. Maples the next year. Donald Jr. went to boarding school, the Hill School in Pottstown, Pa., where he practiced skeet shooting, and then it was on to Wharton, where he rowed crew and joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. People who knew him then saw him as distinct from his parents.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t into the gold,\u201d said Jennifer Ireland Kubis, a New York real estate agent who dated one of Mr. Trump\u2019s college friends. \u201cHe was trying to escape it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe young Mr. Trump also earned a reputation for hard partying, which seems to have continued until the Mardi Gras arrest. He no longer drinks, and he has suggested that the discipline of the sporting life kept him from going over the edge: \u201cI know that the benefits I got from being in the woods, from being in a duck blind, from being in a tree stand at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, kept me out of so much other trouble I would have gotten into in my life,\u201d he said in a speech at a fund-raising banquet for the 2016 Western Hunting and Conservation Expo in Salt Lake City.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring his first year in the family business, he spent weekends at the Mashomack Preserve Club in Pine Plains, N.Y., where he ran into Gentry Beach, an acquaintance from college who was working at a Manhattan investment firm.\n\n\u201cWe loved being outdoors,\u201d said Mr. Beach, who grew up in Dallas.\n\nMr. Beach, 41, introduced Mr. Trump to Thomas Hicks Jr., 39, a Dallas friend whose father, an equity investor, once owned the Texas Rangers. Through the years, the three have hunted white-tailed deer in Texas, birds in Scotland and pheasant in Hungary.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor some people \u2014 you see that in New York a lot \u2014 they go hunting once every other year and they talk about it at a cocktail party for the next two years until they do it again,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview. \u201cFor me, it is the way I choose to live my life.\u201d\n\nBeing friends with Donny, as his closest friends call him, can be tricky, given the divisiveness of his father\u2019s politics. Ms. Sides, for one, said she did not discuss politics with her friend. \u201cOur views are different,\u201d she said. \u201cDon has never asked me, and he would not ask.\u201d\n\nIt was his father who introduced Mr. Trump to Vanessa Haydon, the woman who would become his wife, at a fashion show in 2003. A onetime model with the Wilhelmina agency who once dated Leonardo DiCaprio, she had grown up on the Upper East Side. At the time of their engagement, Mr. Trump accepted a ring from the Bailey Banks & Biddle jewelry store in Short Hills, N.J., in exchange for publicity, recreating his proposal at its Short Hills Mall location in New Jersey. Soon afterward came an unflattering headline in The New York Post: \u201cTrump Jr. Is the Cheapest Gazillionaire: Heirhead Proposes With Free 100G Ring.\u201d Even his father joined in the criticism, saying on the CNN talk show \u201cLarry King Live,\u201d \u201cYou have a name that is hot as a pistol, you have to be very careful with things like this.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDonald Jr. and Vanessa were married at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach on Nov. 12, 2005, 10 months after his father married the former model Melania Knauss. These days Vanessa Trump\u2019s Twitter account, with the handle @MrsVanessaTrump, frequently retweets her husband\u2019s posts pertaining to family life, many of which include photographs of their weekends in the Catskills, where they fish and shoot, and ride A.T.V.s and snowmobiles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBusiness and Politics\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump has been charged with holding down the family business without input from his father \u2014 who resigned his position in the company without relinquishing his financial stake \u2014 he took advantage of his new standing within the Republican Party to dine last Saturday with a group of political heavyweights that included Senator Ted Cruz of Texas at the annual Reagan Day fund-raising dinner, where he delivered a speech.\n\nHe told the crowd that he had had virtually \u201czero contact\u201d with the president since the election, but added that he had found it difficult to resist the pull of politics. \u201cI thought I was out of politics after Election Day,\u201d he said, adding that he had thought he would \u201cget back to my regular life and my family.\n\n\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo weeks before the Dallas speech, Mr. Trump found himself in the role of real estate tycoon during a stop in Vancouver, British Columbia, for the opening of a Trump International Hotel and Tower. Although the building unveiled that day was, at 63 stories, the city\u2019s second highest, the city\u2019s mayor, Gregor Robertson, skipped the event after demanding for two years that the Trump name be stripped from the building\u2019s facade.\n\nThe president\u2019s son began his talk with a poke at the news media: \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the press,\u201d he said. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d Outside, about 100 protesters waved signs and shouted \u201cLove Trumps Hate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo a large degree, his public image has been shaped by photographs that surfaced online in 2012 and re-emerged last year. They were taken during a hunting trip in 2010 arranged by Hunting Legends International, a safari company based in Pretoria, South Africa. A licensed guide accompanied Donald Jr. and Eric, along with a ranger from the Zimbabwe national parks department, who monitored the hunt.\n\nOne photograph shows the Trump brothers taking a helicopter to the Matetsi, a region of Zimbabwe abundant with elephants and endangered leopards. Another shows Eric with his arms wrapped around the limp body of a dead leopard. Perhaps most disturbing to nonhunters and to those who do not hunt endangered or vulnerable species was the picture of Donald Jr., knife in one hand, the bloody tail of an elephant in the other.\n\nNYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.

Donald Jr. took to Twitter to defend himself, writing to one detractor, \u201cI\u2019m not going to run and hide because the PETA crazies don\u2019t like me.\u201d\n\nHe argues that the economic benefit of such safaris to African communities is often overlooked. Further, he said, the controversy allowed him to connect with other sportsmen. \u201cThere were people who I didn\u2019t know who were hunters,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, from that perspective, I get invited a lot.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat is lost on nonhunters, he said, is the sense of community that is part of hunting trips. \u201cToo much of hunting has turned into the notion of the kill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a component, the meat. But so much is experiential, so much is relationships. It is sitting in a duck blind with seven people, cooking breakfast. For me, it\u2019s been a great way to see the world. The least interesting part is the three seconds it takes to pull the trigger.\u201d\n\nBalancing Act\n\nNear the window of Mr. Trump\u2019s 25th-floor office is a framed American flag signed by members of SEAL Team Six, the elite Navy unit that brought down Osama bin Laden. On his desk he displays a bronze statue of Theodore Roosevelt, the Republican president and hunter, and a bobblehead doll depicting his father.\n\nIf he does not have his father\u2019s gift for theatrics, he does share the president\u2019s unwillingness to back down from comments and Twitter posts that roil liberals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a curated kind of guy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t sit there and try to massage every possible word. I\u2019m probably a little more like my father in that sense. You know, I say what I\u2019m thinking. Most logical people will interpret it right. But if you are looking to create a story, you can probably come up with something. I learned about that the hard way, in terms of politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWithout much of a campaign apparatus last year, the younger Mr. Trump traveled in the company of his Dallas friends Mr. Beach and Mr. Hicks. \u201cThey did everything from help me raise money, to get in front of the right people, to carry my bags, to handling schedules,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the Republican convention in Cleveland last summer, he made use of a trope that served his father well: targeting the elite, despite his own privilege. \u201cWe\u2019ve produced the thickest network of patronage and influence of any country at any time in world history,\u201d he said from the stage. \u201cIt\u2019s composed of a self-satisfied people at the top, our new aristocrats.\u201d\n\nCritics said his views were influenced by white nationalists. After an interview with a Philadelphia radio station, he was accused of making a Holocaust reference when he warned that the media would be \u201cwarming up the gas chamber\u201d for Republicans who behaved like Hillary Clinton. The Trump campaign later said he had been talking about \u201ccapital punishment.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump was also interviewed on a radio show hosted by James Edwards, who has described himself as a \u201cEuropean-American advocate\u201d and whom some have called a white supremacist. Mr. Trump was criticized, too, for earning an estimated $50,000 for delivering a speech at an October event at the Ritz Paris hosted by the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs, a French think tank whose organizers have promoted Russian interests in Syria and elsewhere. He declined to comment on his speech.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Twitter he has reposted false reports and passed along memes favored by white nationalists. An example of this occurred during the campaign, when he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles candies sprinkled with a few that \u201cwould kill you.\u201d He also retweeted a post by @voxday, who claimed that a woman making a Nazi salute at a Trump rally was a supporter of Bernie Sanders. The claim was false. (Further, @voxday is a pseudonym for the writer Theodore Beale, an advocate for the alt-right movement.)\n\nMr. Trump said he did not know who Mr. Beale was. \u201cIt just popped up in my timeline when someone retweeted it,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRecently he reposted a Twitter message that said CNN tried to silence guests who went against its supposed liberal agenda. It was also untrue and was later deleted.\n\nWhile he mainly uses Twitter to defend the president, with frequent attacks on liberals thrown in, Mr. Trump also uses it for posts about his family, with many including photos of his wife and children.

There is his son Tristan, snuggling with his parents in bed.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/fashion/19DONJR/19DONJR-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/fashion/19DONJRJP1/19DONJRJP1-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/19/fashion/12RELUCTANT1-WEB/12RELUCTANT1-WEB-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/25/fashion/25TIFFANY/25TIFFANY-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/fashion/19DONJRJP6/19DONJRJP6-master675.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/fashion/19DONJRJP2/19DONJRJP2-blog427.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/fashion/19DONJR/19DONJR-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/fashion/19DONJRJP5/19DONJRJP5-master675.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/05/fashion/05CRITIC1/05CRITIC1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/fashion/19DONJRJP3/19DONJRJP3-master675.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/fashion/19DONJRJP4/19DONJRJP4-master315-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/04/fashion/04COVER1/04COVER1-thumbStandard.jpg"], "videos": []}
