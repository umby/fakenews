As a matter of fact, we had discussions about changing it back.

(National Gallery of Art) </div> </div> <p><strong>-- James Madison, a genius in the truest sense of the word, designed the Senate to be a cooling saucer, making it hard for narrow majorities to force their will on everyone else. </strong>Remember, the original intent of the framers was that there should not even be direct election of senators. The upper chamber was&nbsp;where learned elites were supposed to prevent mob rule and smaller states were given enough clout to protect their rights from being infringed. The House, with two-year terms and smaller districts, is more directly accountable to the people. The lower chamber\u2019s rules further empower the majority. Historically, that&nbsp;body is more volatile, unruly and passes farther-reaching legislation, which gets watered down in conference committees.</p> <p>The framers expected most members of the House to be amateurs who would come and go, while senators would benefit from cumulative experience. The point of having the Senate was to make sure legislation got a second reading by a more mature body of legislators. This is a feature, not a bug, of our system. Without the unique bicameral configuration, the Constitution might not have survived for 230 years.</p> <p><strong>Just like today, past changes to the Senate rules were also driven by altruistic intentions. </strong>One hundred years ago, a group of 11 senators blocked a bill that would have allowed U.S. merchant ships to arm themselves against German U-boats as World War I raged in Europe. The body responded by voting to add a new rule that allowed two-thirds of members to cut off debate, so that measures with near universal support couldn\u2019t be obstructed. In 1975, Walter Mondale negotiated a deal to reduce the threshold for stopping debate from 66 votes to 60 votes. The Minnesotan spent 15 years fighting for this change, in part, because he wanted to make it easier to pass civil rights legislation over the objections of segregationist southerners.</p> <p><strong>No matter your politics, obstruction can be good. The filibuster has served a valuable purpose at key junctures in our history: </strong>In 1968, for instance, conservatives blocked Lyndon Johnson from elevating his crony Abe Fortas to replace Earl Warren as chief justice. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2008/05/abe-fortas-resigns-from-supreme-court-may-15-1969-010346\">Fortas resigned</a> the next year to avoid being impeached over secret payments he had been receiving.</p> <p><strong>Ultimately, over the long term, the Senate becoming more majoritarian is worse for conservatives than liberals. </strong>The right, after all, does not want to pass sweeping laws that expand the size and scope of government. If Democrats had a majority and the legislative filibuster was gone, the left could raise taxes, jack up the minimum wage to $15, create universal health coverage, expand eligibility for other entitlements and enact cap-and-trade.</p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/579f847165719bf78ac61b5bddba3cb0-908-605-490A8031.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Mitch McConnell talks to the press on Capitol Hill. (Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post) </div> </div> <p><strong>-- McConnell, who won his seat in 1984, gets it. He and his allies say they will maintain the legislative filibuster as long as he is majority leader.&nbsp;</strong>But the Republican base distrusts Washington and the party establishment. He has become the avatar of both. Explaining the virtues of the legislative filibuster in a 30-second ad or a mailer is exceptionally hard, especially when you have control and you already got rid of it for lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court.</p> <p><strong>Consider that McConnell is up for reelection in 2020, the same year as Trump. </strong>What will he do if the president starts attacking him on Twitter every day for blocking his agenda by not getting rid of the legislative filibuster? The president could fly to Louisville and say that Obamacare repeal and so much else didn\u2019t happen because McConnell is clinging to an outdated rule that would be relatively easy to get rid of. What if Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart News peddled the narrative every day that McConnell is complicit in Democratic obstruction? What if Ted Cruz and Mike Lee were calling into talk radio saying that there\u2019s so much good stuff that could get done if McConnell would just back off on the legislative filibuster? And what if the majority leader faced a well-funded primary challenger? Would he really stick to his principles at that point? Really?</p> <p><strong>\u201cLike Chekhov\u2019s gun, destined to be fired by the third act once it appeared on the wall in the first, this moment was certain to arrive from the day that [Reid] first pulled the nuclear trigger,\u201d Ruth Marcus lamented in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-probably-futile-plea-for-sanity-in-the-senate/2017/04/03/01a220d8-18a8-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html?utm_term=.61b0fed643d8\">her column earlier this week</a>.</strong> She was referring to what\u2019s happening now, but the same principle of playwriting applies to the legislative filibuster as well.</p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/9e5f7a663d235f65aed27cee371e38a1-908-605-schumer03.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Chuck Schumer talks with The Post in his office about blocking Neil Gorsuch.

McMaster, an Army three-star general who took over the post after retired general Michael Flynn was ousted in February and who is increasingly asserting himself over the flow of national security information in the White House. McMaster has become a blunt force within the administration who has made clear to several top officials and the president that he does not want the NSC to have any political elements. Two senior White House officials said that Bannon\u2019s departure was in no way a demotion and that he had rarely attended meetings since being placed on the council.</p> <p><strong>\u201cBannon's place on the committee had been a subject of intense controversy \u2026</strong> [and national security experts] characterized it as an elevation of a White House official with no national security experience, even while other national security officials in the administration were included on the NSC only when \u2018issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise\u2019 were involved,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201c[But] White House officials strongly disputed that characterization \u2026 [saying] Bannon\u2019s role early on \u2026 was to guide and in essence keep watch over Flynn, who was tasked with reshaping the operation but whose management style could be combative.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- Bannon threatened to resign from his White House post amid continued West Wing infighting \u2013 namely with Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2013 but he was convinced to stay on by Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer,&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/bannon-resign-mercer-trump-236939\">Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson, Kenneth P. Vogel and Josh Dawsey report</a>: \u201cBannon has complained that Kushner and his allies are trying to undermine his populist approach \u2026 [but] Mercer, a longtime Bannon confidante who became a prominent Trump supporter during the campaign, urged Bannon not to resign. [One] person familiar with the situation, a GOP operative who talks to Mercer, said: <strong>\u2018Bekah tried to convince him that this is a long-term play.\u2019</strong> The tension between the two is indicative of a larger power struggle in the White House as Kushner\u2019s prominence and responsibility have ballooned. Kushner has also told people that he thinks Mercer as well as her father \u2026 have taken too much credit for their role in his victory, and has expressed misgivings about their go-it-alone approach to outside spending boosting Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d <strong>\u201cIf Bannon leaves the White House, Bekah\u2019s access and influence shrinks dramatically,\u201d said the GOP operative who talks to Mercer.</strong></p> <p><strong>-- \u201cThe removal of Bannon from the NSC comes in the wake of a series of other moves -- most notably the arrival of Trump's daughter, Ivanka, in the West Wing -- that suggest that the president is moving away (at least for the moment) from the more hard-line ideological bent of Bannon,\u201d </strong><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/05/politics/steve-bannon-national-security-council/\">CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza writes</a>. \u201cThe Trump White House sought to spin the Bannon decision not as a demotion but rather a natural conclusion to his initial appointment to the principals committee. But, that doesn't really check out. If Bannon's position on the NSC was always meant to be temporary why not say that from the outset? It's hard not to see the Bannon move in the broader context of Trump's first 75 days in office, which have been, to put it mildly, chaotic \u2026 While Trump -- like all politicians -- is loathe to admit a change of direction is needed or that mistakes have been made, it's hard to look at his current position and conclude anything else. To be clear: Bannon will remain in the White House -- and in a senior role. But the diminution of his power -- and in such a public way -- is a clear sign that a shakeup in the Trump power structure is under way.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- A&nbsp;former&nbsp;Breitbart News writer, who worked under Bannon, is launching a radio show for the Russian propaganda network Sputnik.</strong> \u201cI\u2019m on the Russian payroll now.

But the latest round has posed a unique set of challenges.\u201d</p> <p><strong>THE PUNDITS WEIGH IN:</strong></p> <p><strong>-- In a tongue-and-cheek column, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/opinion/jared-kushner-man-of-steel.html\">New York Times' Frank Bruni</a> highlights the scope of Jared Kushner\u2019s to-do list \u2013 and what it says about the man who tasked him with such an impossible agenda:</strong>&nbsp;\u201cKushner\u2019s to-do list \u2026 contains the small, pesky item of brokering a durable truce between the Israelis and the Palestinians. \u2018If you can\u2019t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can,\u2019 Trump [told Kushner], who has absolutely no background in diplomacy.&nbsp;But he\u2019ll figure it out in those down moments. [And] take note: When you file your taxes in about two weeks, you can send them either to the [IRS] or to Kushner<strong>. </strong>He\u2019ll be chipping in with the auditing. I jest \u2026 But Kushner\u2019s many mandates aren\u2019t a laughing matter. They\u2019re a reflection of some of Trump\u2019s most unsettling traits as president, and Kushner is a symbol of his delusions.&nbsp;The president seems to see certain people as exempt from the laws of gravity, and he has accorded Kushner a place snug beside him in that pantheon. ... I\u2019m told by insiders that when Trump\u2019s long-shot campaign led to victory, he and Kushner became convinced not only that they\u2019d tapped into something that everybody was missing about America, but that they\u2019d tapped into something that everybody was missing about the two of them. Kushner was reborn with new powers, and to the heavens he ascended. It\u2019s a bird! It\u2019s a plane! It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- \u201cA raft of critics have recently come after Jared and Ivanka, alleging that they don\u2019t know a thing about policy (well, yeah) and that they\u2019re awash in ethical conflicts (like <em>that</em> matters),\u201d <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/jared-ivanka-ask-country-can-090040557.html\">Yahoo News\u2019 Matt Bai writes</a>. </strong>\u201cBut the problem with Washington\u2019s newest power couple is larger and more pervasive than any of that, and it illuminates the underlying darkness in this administration[:] Jared and Ivanka are accountable to exactly no one.\u201d</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;\u201cAnd this gets to the heart of my issue with Kushner and Ivanka, and with the Trump family acquisition of the White House generally.</strong> Basically, they\u2019ve decided all of a sudden that they\u2019d very much like to run the country for a spell, but they\u2019re not willing to sacrifice a \u2026 thing for the privilege. Public service is a playground to them, an accidental hobby. I\u2019d be willing to give Jared and Ivanka the benefit of the doubt \u2014 even absent any obvious humility or aptitude for their jobs \u2014 if they were willing to entirely divest themselves from competing interests, as Cabinet secretaries do. They won\u2019t, because it\u2019s not their way \u2026 To the Trump-Kushner axis, those people are just suckers who don\u2019t have what it takes to get rich, or at least to be born that way. <strong>The privileges they inherited are theirs to keep while they meddle around with policies that affect the rest of us. The honor, I guess, is all ours.\u201d</strong></p> <p><strong>-- <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/04/05/how-donald-trump-is-already-creating-a-world-of-chaos/?utm_term=.525604c9ed03\">Paul Waldman</a>&nbsp;writes on the Plum Line Blog that Trump is already creating a \u201cworld of chaos\u201d:</strong> \u201cTrump is stepping up military action in places where the United States is already engaged, advocating huge increases in military spending, and simultaneously trying to gut the State Department. His secretary of state seems to be sleepwalking through his job, and is operating with barely any staff; it\u2019s obvious that the administration regards diplomacy as little more than a distraction. <strong>With regard to Syria, the administration\u2019s position is literally that</strong> <strong>1) it\u2019s bad for Assad to kill civilians, but 2) we don\u2019t want anyone fleeing that war to come to America, and 3) it\u2019s all Obama\u2019s fault anyway. </strong>\u2026 It isn\u2019t even clear what goals the administration will be pursuing. What kind of world would Trump like to create? Your guess is as good as mine.

That\u2019s a complicated question</strong></a><strong>,\u201d by Paul Farhi:</strong> \u201cIs Bill O\u2019Reilly too big to fire? The question wouldn\u2019t even have been asked just a few days ago. The most popular attraction on cable, O\u2019Reilly seemed to be Fox News Channel\u2019s indispensable man, the embodiment of its pugnacious identity. Now? The question is plausible, but the likely answer is unsatisfying: It depends \u2014 on multiple, unpredictable factors. &nbsp;Major companies \u2026 said they were \u2018suspending\u2019 their ads on the show until \u2014 well, it\u2019s not clear when \u2018until\u2019 is. And that could be one, if not the, decisive factor in \u2018The O\u2019Reilly Factor\u2019s\u2019 continued existence. A sustained and widespread advertiser shunning of O\u2019Reilly would be painful, undermining a key economic rationale for his program. [On the other hand] \u2026 advertising losses, if any, are just one part of the financial picture for Fox. The bulk of revenue for cable networks come from cable and satellite providers that deliver the programs to viewers. And this money flows from long-term contracts, unaffected by momentary controversies<strong>. In this regard, what O\u2019Reilly\u2019s audience does, rather than his advertisers, may be of greater importance to Fox\u2019s bottom line.\u201d</strong></p> <p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:</strong></p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/2bc58e2d8583dbe0e03db989939b991f-908-615-20170405T193512Z_1574651486_RC1A6EFDCE10_RTRMADP_3_USAJORDAN.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Melania&nbsp;Trump and Jordanian Queen&nbsp;Rania&nbsp;Al-Abdullah visited an all-girls charter school,&nbsp;joined by Education Secretary Betsy&nbsp;DeVos, to promote empowerment of young women while also advancing the White House\u2019s interest in promoting alternatives to public schools.

option to confirm Neil Gorsuch. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nWith Breanne Deppisch\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: The Senate is careening down a slippery slope.\n\nRepublicans voted Thursday to change the rules of the chamber to allow for Neil Gorsuch to be confirmed to the Supreme Court with a simple majority. They believe Harry Reid deserves the blame for their decision to \"go nuclear\" because he lowered the threshold for non-Supreme Court nominees in 2013.\n\nRight now, however, the majority and minority leaders agree that 60 votes should still be required to break a legislative filibuster, for bills related to issues like health care and tax reform:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the legislative filibuster is in danger,\u201d says Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). \u201cThere is not a single senator from the majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any thirst to change the legislative rules,\u201d adds Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cMost Democrats and most Republicans have served in both the minority and majority and know what it means.\u201d\n\nBut both parties are becoming more and more beholden to their respective bases of support. And as soon as McConnell loosens the rules for judicial nominees, he is certain to face intensifying pressure from conservative activists and Donald Trump\u2019s White House to do it again for legislation. He may be able to resist, but historians, political scientists and several senators on both sides think that today\u2019s move makes that leap eventually inevitable.\n\nBob Corker, on the left, chairs a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Among Republicans, he was the most outspoken about the risk of going nuclear. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\n-- Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) dropped a truth bomb during an important but little-noticed floor speech last week. \u201cEverybody says: Oh, we are never going to do it on legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on! \u2026 If we continue on the path we are on right now, the very next time there is a legislative proposal that one side of the aisle feels is so important they cannot let their base down, the pressure builds, and then we are going to invoke the nuclear option on the legislative piece too. That is what will happen. Somebody will do it.\u201d\n\nCorker candidly acknowledged that Reid went nuclear in 2013 because Republicans were blocking Barack Obama nominees who were \u201cactually pretty decent\u201d from being confirmed. \u201cBut we did not want the balance of the D.C. Circuit to change because it was at four to four,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Tennessean also nodded to how unprecedented it was for his party to block Merrick Garland last year, announcing just hours after Antonin Scalia\u2019s death that no one Obama picked would even get a hearing. \u201cIt was a pretty audacious move, let's face it, and obviously it created some hard feelings on the other side,\u201d he said.\n\nCorker argued that the Garland and Gorsuch blockades, respectively, show neither party can withstand pressure from its base. \u201cLet's face it: If we do not have respect for the institution we serve and for ourselves, no one else will,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us to act like if we do it here, there is no way we would ever do it on a legislative piece--let me tell you this: \u2026 Two years ago, there would not have been a single Republican in our caucus who would have even considered voting for the nuclear option (now). As a matter of fact, we had discussions about changing it back. Then the election occurred, and we decided not to do that. \u2026 To say that we will never get to the point at which we will not change a legislative piece--give me a break! Somebody is not living in reality!\u201d\n\n-- Cornell Law School professor Josh Chafetz studied the filibuster exhaustively for a book called \u201cCongress\u2019s Constitution\u201d that will come out in June. Based on his research, he agrees that it is a matter of when, not if, the body gets rid of it for legislation. \u201cGiven that a number of Senate Republicans are skeptical of significant portions of President Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, one can imagine that they feel no tremendous need to smooth the way for that agenda\u2019s passage,\u201d he writes in an op-ed this morning. \u201cStill, there will come a point \u2014 if not under this majority leader, then under some other \u2014 when the legislative filibuster consistently frustrates lawmaking in which the party that controls Washington is deeply invested. When that day comes, the history of legislative obstruction would suggest that the filibuster won\u2019t be long for this world.\u201d\n\n-- Except for a handful of senators, nearly all 100 members recognize that what happened today will be a body blow to the institution. But both sides have fixated more on assigning blame for the chamber\u2019s continuing race to the bottom than stopping the slow-motion car crash. Indeed, there has been strikingly little intellectual honesty during this week\u2019s debate. Rank hypocrisy abounded on both sides.\n\nFive years ago, McConnell said he would not invoke the nuclear option for Supreme Court nominees. Back then, he called it \u201cone of the most cherished safeguards of liberty in our government\u2014the right of a political minority to have a voice.\u201d Now he argues that doing so will be good for the Senate.\n\n\u201cIdiot,\u201d John McCain told Paul Kane yesterday. \u201cWhoever says that is a stupid idiot, who has not been here and seen what I\u2019ve been through and how we were able to avoid that on several occasions. And they are stupid and they\u2019ve deceived their voters because they are so stupid.\u201d The Arizona Republican led a bipartisan \u201cGang of 14\u201d to save the filibuster back in 2005. Now he is going along with McConnell\u2019s push because he thinks Gorsuch is reasonable and Democrats are not blocking him in good faith. But he refuses to parrot his party\u2019s talking point that doing so will be good for the Senate. Asked about the \u201cidiot\u201d line from McCain, McConnell laughed and declined to comment.\n\nA portrait of James Madison by Gilbert Stuart. (National Gallery of Art)\n\n-- James Madison, a genius in the truest sense of the word, designed the Senate to be a cooling saucer, making it hard for narrow majorities to force their will on everyone else. Remember, the original intent of the framers was that there should not even be direct election of senators. The upper chamber was where learned elites were supposed to prevent mob rule and smaller states were given enough clout to protect their rights from being infringed. The House, with two-year terms and smaller districts, is more directly accountable to the people. The lower chamber\u2019s rules further empower the majority. Historically, that body is more volatile, unruly and passes farther-reaching legislation, which gets watered down in conference committees.\n\nThe framers expected most members of the House to be amateurs who would come and go, while senators would benefit from cumulative experience. The point of having the Senate was to make sure legislation got a second reading by a more mature body of legislators. This is a feature, not a bug, of our system. Without the unique bicameral configuration, the Constitution might not have survived for 230 years.\n\nJust like today, past changes to the Senate rules were also driven by altruistic intentions. One hundred years ago, a group of 11 senators blocked a bill that would have allowed U.S. merchant ships to arm themselves against German U-boats as World War I raged in Europe. The body responded by voting to add a new rule that allowed two-thirds of members to cut off debate, so that measures with near universal support couldn\u2019t be obstructed. In 1975, Walter Mondale negotiated a deal to reduce the threshold for stopping debate from 66 votes to 60 votes. The Minnesotan spent 15 years fighting for this change, in part, because he wanted to make it easier to pass civil rights legislation over the objections of segregationist southerners.\n\nNo matter your politics, obstruction can be good. The filibuster has served a valuable purpose at key junctures in our history: In 1968, for instance, conservatives blocked Lyndon Johnson from elevating his crony Abe Fortas to replace Earl Warren as chief justice. Fortas resigned the next year to avoid being impeached over secret payments he had been receiving.\n\nUltimately, over the long term, the Senate becoming more majoritarian is worse for conservatives than liberals. The right, after all, does not want to pass sweeping laws that expand the size and scope of government. If Democrats had a majority and the legislative filibuster was gone, the left could raise taxes, jack up the minimum wage to $15, create universal health coverage, expand eligibility for other entitlements and enact cap-and-trade.\n\nMitch McConnell talks to the press on Capitol Hill. (Oliver Contreras/For The Washington Post)\n\n-- McConnell, who won his seat in 1984, gets it. He and his allies say they will maintain the legislative filibuster as long as he is majority leader. But the Republican base distrusts Washington and the party establishment. He has become the avatar of both. Explaining the virtues of the legislative filibuster in a 30-second ad or a mailer is exceptionally hard, especially when you have control and you already got rid of it for lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court.\n\nConsider that McConnell is up for reelection in 2020, the same year as Trump. What will he do if the president starts attacking him on Twitter every day for blocking his agenda by not getting rid of the legislative filibuster? The president could fly to Louisville and say that Obamacare repeal and so much else didn\u2019t happen because McConnell is clinging to an outdated rule that would be relatively easy to get rid of. What if Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart News peddled the narrative every day that McConnell is complicit in Democratic obstruction? What if Ted Cruz and Mike Lee were calling into talk radio saying that there\u2019s so much good stuff that could get done if McConnell would just back off on the legislative filibuster? And what if the majority leader faced a well-funded primary challenger? Would he really stick to his principles at that point? Really?\n\n\u201cLike Chekhov\u2019s gun, destined to be fired by the third act once it appeared on the wall in the first, this moment was certain to arrive from the day that [Reid] first pulled the nuclear trigger,\u201d Ruth Marcus lamented in her column earlier this week. She was referring to what\u2019s happening now, but the same principle of playwriting applies to the legislative filibuster as well.\n\nChuck Schumer talks with The Post in his office about blocking Neil Gorsuch. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\n-- The bigger picture: Thursday's move really should be viewed in the context of a long-running parliamentary arms race. \u201cIt is tempting to view Democrats\u2019 behavior as payback for Republican norm-breaking that blocked Garland. And in the short term, it is,\u201d writes George Washington University political science professor Sarah Binder. \u201cBut the longer view reveals an equally important dynamic. As the parties become ever more polarized, party majorities have been looking to the Senate rules to find new ways to pursue their agendas.\u201d\n\nPartisanship has been on a steady rise in the Senate for decades. One measure Binder uses to illustrate the dynamic is the increasing partisan conflict in the outcomes of cloture votes. She created the chart below to show the average party differences on cloture votes, which is to say, the difference between the percentage of majority and minority party senators voting yea. \u201cIf 90 percent of the majority party and just 20 percent of the minority party vote in favor of cloture, the difference is 70 percent,\u201d she explains in a new post for our Monkey Cage blog. \u201cRemarkably, procedural partisanship has more than doubled since the 1970s \u2026 You can\u2019t see this in the figure, but since the first Bush administration, Democrats have filed for cloture significantly more often than have Republicans \u2014 suggesting that the GOP has more aggressively tried to block the majority than have Democrats.\u201d\n\nDeclining judicial confirmation rates are just one manifestation of this:\n\n\u201cThe longer-term evolution of the Senate has followed a very slow path toward majority rule,\u201d Binder concludes. \u201cSenators have rarely reversed course, suggesting that a cohesive and ambitious Senate party could one day be tempted to finish the march to majority rule.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump and her daughter, Arabella Kushner, walk down the steps of the Supreme Court last month after attending oral arguments at the encouragement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who extended an invitation when they met at an inauguration lunch. (Molly Riley/AP)\n\n-- COAXING KENNEDY TO RETIRE: Trump\u2019s White House is already gearing up for the next Supreme Court vacancy.

McMaster has become a blunt force within the administration who has made clear to several top officials and the president that he does not want the NSC to have any political elements. Two senior White House officials said that Bannon\u2019s departure was in no way a demotion and that he had rarely attended meetings since being placed on the council.\n\n\u201cBannon's place on the committee had been a subject of intense controversy \u2026 [and national security experts] characterized it as an elevation of a White House official with no national security experience, even while other national security officials in the administration were included on the NSC only when \u2018issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise\u2019 were involved,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201c[But] White House officials strongly disputed that characterization \u2026 [saying] Bannon\u2019s role early on \u2026 was to guide and in essence keep watch over Flynn, who was tasked with reshaping the operation but whose management style could be combative.\u201d\n\n-- Bannon threatened to resign from his White House post amid continued West Wing infighting \u2013 namely with Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2013 but he was convinced to stay on by Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer, Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson, Kenneth P. Vogel and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cBannon has complained that Kushner and his allies are trying to undermine his populist approach \u2026 [but] Mercer, a longtime Bannon confidante who became a prominent Trump supporter during the campaign, urged Bannon not to resign. [One] person familiar with the situation, a GOP operative who talks to Mercer, said: \u2018Bekah tried to convince him that this is a long-term play.\u2019 The tension between the two is indicative of a larger power struggle in the White House as Kushner\u2019s prominence and responsibility have ballooned. Kushner has also told people that he thinks Mercer as well as her father \u2026 have taken too much credit for their role in his victory, and has expressed misgivings about their go-it-alone approach to outside spending boosting Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d \u201cIf Bannon leaves the White House, Bekah\u2019s access and influence shrinks dramatically,\u201d said the GOP operative who talks to Mercer.\n\n-- \u201cThe removal of Bannon from the NSC comes in the wake of a series of other moves -- most notably the arrival of Trump's daughter, Ivanka, in the West Wing -- that suggest that the president is moving away (at least for the moment) from the more hard-line ideological bent of Bannon,\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza writes. \u201cThe Trump White House sought to spin the Bannon decision not as a demotion but rather a natural conclusion to his initial appointment to the principals committee. But, that doesn't really check out. If Bannon's position on the NSC was always meant to be temporary why not say that from the outset? It's hard not to see the Bannon move in the broader context of Trump's first 75 days in office, which have been, to put it mildly, chaotic \u2026 While Trump -- like all politicians -- is loathe to admit a change of direction is needed or that mistakes have been made, it's hard to look at his current position and conclude anything else. To be clear: Bannon will remain in the White House -- and in a senior role. But the diminution of his power -- and in such a public way -- is a clear sign that a shakeup in the Trump power structure is under way.\u201d\n\n-- A former Breitbart News writer, who worked under Bannon, is launching a radio show for the Russian propaganda network Sputnik. \u201cI\u2019m on the Russian payroll now. When you work at Sputnik, you\u2019re being paid by the Russians,\u201d Lee Stranahan, who served as an investigative reporter for the site, told The Atlantic\u2019s Rosie Gray. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is. I don\u2019t have any qualms about it. Nothing about it really affects my position on stuff that I\u2019ve had for years now.\u201d The Breitbart alumnus dismisses stories about Trump's links to Russia as \u201cbogus.\u201d Additionally, he says he is considering offers from two different companies to cover the White House.\n\nTRUMP SAYS HE'S EVOLVING ON SYRIA:\n\n-- Trump discussed Syria and the Islamic State during a joint news conference with King Abdullah II of Jordan Wednesday, acknowledging that he is now responsible for handling the ongoing Syrian crisis, even as he provided no details on how he intends to address the attack. He also signaled vaguely that his position on Assad has changed. Abby Phillip reports: \u201cI now have responsibility,\u201d Trump said, speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden Wednesday. \u201cIt crossed a lot of lines for me. When you kill innocent children, innocent babies \u2014 babies, little babies \u2014 with a chemical gas that is so lethal \u2026 that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line.\u201d The remarks were the first in which the president described the impact that footage from the attacks had on him \u2013 and he suggested his position on military engagement in Syria may have shifted.\n\n\u201cI do change and I am flexible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me. Big impact. \u2026 It's very, very possible that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much,\u201d he said. But he refused to disclose his strategy: \u201cOne of the things I think you've noticed about me is militarily I don't like to say where I'm going and what I'm doing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I\u2019m certainly not going to be telling you.\u201d\n\n-- Notably, he continued to refrain from mentioning Russia in his remarks -- even as another official from his administration, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, assailed Moscow for its staunch diplomatic and military support of the Assad regime. Anne Gearan reports: \u201cHow many more children have to die before Russia cares?\u201d Haley said in New York, speaking at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting devoted to the chemical attack. \u201cWhen the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action,\u201d Haley said.\n\nRussia\u2019s representative lamented what he called \u201cclearly an ideological thrust\u201d to the discussion at the Security Council. \u201cAccusations of the Assad regime\u2019s involvement are \u2018closely interwoven with the anti-Damascus campaign, which hasn\u2019t yet reached the place it deserves on the landfill of history,\u2019 Russian representative Sergey Kononuchenko said. Instead, they said, Syrian rebels were to blame.\n\n-- Trump has vowed to follow a radically new approach to foreign policy that prioritizes America\u2019s immediate economic and security interests over attempts at moral leadership. But crises in Syria and North Korea are now putting his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy to the test. Greg Jaffe writes: \u201cDespite [Trump\u2019s tough talk Wednesday], the Syrian chemical weapons attack poses a particular problem for Trump\u2019s foreign policy philosophy. The attack by Assad\u2019s forces offends America\u2019s values and it violates long-standing international norms of behavior, but it does not present an immediate threat to America\u2019s security or its economic interests. In an \u2018America First\u2019 world, it is an atrocity, but hardly a call to action for the United States and its allies. The big question was how long Trump\u2019s sense of outrage would last and whether it would lead to substantive action ... \u2018The president just made a statement on Assad that looks 180 degrees different from his actual policy,\u2019 said Kori Schake, a research fellow at Stanford University \u2026 \u201cThis may be a scattershot administration with a president that responds to near-term stimulus rather than long-term planning or strategy.\u201d\n\nA Syrian man says goodbye to his twin babies who were killed, along with his wife, in the suspected chemical attack. (AP/Alaa Alyousef)\n\nTHE GROUND TRUTH:\n\n-- Heartbreaking footage continues to emerge, including the above photo of 29-year-old Abdul Hamid Alyousef, rocking the lifeless bodies of his nine-month-old twin daughters as he says his final goodbyes. Youssef says he lost 25 members of his extended family -- including his wife -- in the attack. When the airstrike took place, \"I was right beside them and I carried them outside the house with their mother,\" Alyousef told the AP. \"They were conscious at first, but 10 minutes later we could smell the odor.\"\n\n-- Top medical groups have concluded that the chemical agent used in the attack likely involved a banned nerve agent. Louisa Loveluck and Zakaria Zakaria report: This week\u2019s attack was the deadliest assault on civilians in Syria since Assad\u2019s forces attacked rebel-held suburbs of Damascus with sarin in 2013, bringing the Obama administration to the brink of war. Meanwhile, officials said victims showed symptoms \u201cconsistent\u201d with reaction to the nerve agent, which Assad agreed to destroy years ago in order to stave off U.S. military intervention. Doctors Without Borders said its medics treated patients with diluted pupils, muscle spasms and involuntary defecation \u201cconsistent with exposure to neurotoxic agents such as sarin.\u201d Global treaties have long banned the use of chemical substances, some of which can kill \u201cwithin minutes.\u201d\n\nNYT INTERVIEW:\n\n-- Trump said, without evidence, that former national security adviser Susan Rice \u201cmay have committed a crime\u201d by seeking the identities of Trump associates picked up during intelligence collection. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the biggest story,\u201d Trump told the New York Times in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time.\u201d When asked if Rice had committed a crime, he said: \u201cDo I think? Yes, I think.\u201d His unsubstantiated claim came one day after Rice strongly pushed back on reports of impropriety in an MSNBC interview, calling allegations that she utilized intelligence for political purposes \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d On Wednesday, she declined to comment through a spokesman: \u201cI\u2019m not going to dignify the President\u2019s ludicrous charge with a comment.\u201d (Abby Phillip has a spot story. Glenn Kessler tries to sort out what's true and false about Trump's comments.)\n\n-- Trump also defended embattled Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly, praising him as \u201ca good person\u201d and declaring, \u201cI don\u2019t think Bill did anything wrong.\u201d Days after the Times reported that five women had received settlements after making harassment claims against him, Trump told Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush: \u201cPersonally, I think he shouldn\u2019t have settled. Because you should have taken it all the way; I don\u2019t think Bill did anything wrong.\u201d\n\n-- The president also declined to say whether he would contact Putin about his support for the Assad regime in wake of this week\u2019s chemical attacks: \u201cI never talk about what I do militarily. I\u2019ve been complaining about that for years. In terms of Syria. I just don\u2019t talk about it. People say, \u2018Will you do something with Syria?\u2019 I just don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d (Read the transcript here.)\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security John Kelly arrives to testify before a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing yesterday. (Zach Gibson/Getty Images)\n\nPERSONNEL IS POLICY:\n\n-- Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said it is \u201cdoubtful\u201d that a full border wall with Mexico will ever actually be built. \"It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,\" Kelly told senators on the Homeland Security Committee Wednesday. Instead, he said, the department will look to build physical barriers such as fencing and concrete walls \"in places that make sense.\" \"The first bids for prototypes of the border wall were due Tuesday,\" the New York Times reports. \"According to people briefed on the agency\u2019s plan, the first new section of the wall will be built on a short strip of federally owned land in San Diego, where there is already fencing.\u201d\n\n-- Scott Pruitt is moving to dismantle two programs at the EPA focused on limiting childhood exposure to lead-based paint \u2013 known to cause damage to developing brains and nervous systems \u2013 by $16.61 million.

(Chris Mooney and Juliet Eilperin)\n\n-- Scott Gottlieb, Trump's nominee to lead the FDA, said that the country\u2019s opioid crisis is as serious a threat as Ebola and Zika, vowing during his confirmation hearing that he would make the epidemic his \u201chighest priority.\u201d His comments came a day after two senators whose states have been hit particularly hard by prescription painkillers opposed his nomination, saying his record, as well as his \u201cextensive ties\u201d to the pharmaceutical industry, suggested he would not use the right tools to fight the problem. (Laurie McGinley)\n\n-- Top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn said he supports splitting lending and investment banks during a private meeting with lawmakers Wednesday \u2013 backing a policy that could radically reshape Wall Street\u2019s biggest firms.

Two Post reports from across the pond:\n\n-- \u201cAmericans and Western Europeans have only just begun to wake up to Russia\u2019s use of information as a tool of mischief. But it\u2019s nothing new to the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which regained their independence from the old Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1990s,\u201d Christian Caryl writes. \u201cFor the past quarter of a century they\u2019ve been doing their best to respond to the inflow of destabilizing innuendo from their huge neighbor to the east. Interference with elections? Check. Cyberattacks? Check. Prominent politicians with murky links to the Kremlin? Check. Fake news and skillfully targeted rumors? Double check. Along the way the Balts have learned important lessons that their friends in the United States and Western Europe would do well to note. Most experts stress that trying to debunk every fake story spewed out by Moscow\u2019s giant lie machine is the wrong way to go.\u201d \u201cThey have a huge toolbox,\u201d says Estonian foreign intelligence chief Mikk Maran. \u201cRussia has been active. The West has been reactive.\u201d \u201cIf you only focus on countering, you\u2019re on their territory,\u201d says Ben Heap, a member of a NATO think tank based in Riga, Latvia.\n\n-- \u201cHow do you stop fake news? In Germany, with a law,\" by Anthony Faiola and Stephanie Kirchner: \u201cGermany officially unveiled a landmark social-media bill Wednesday that could quickly turn this nation into a test case in the effort to combat the spread of fake news and hate speech in the West. The highly anticipated draft bill is also highly contentious, with critics denouncing it as a curb on free speech. If passed, as now appears likely, the measure would compel large outlets such as Facebook and Twitter to rapidly remove fake news that incites hate, as well as other \u201ccriminal\u201d content, or face fines as high as 50 million euros ($53 million). Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cabinet agreed on the draft bill Wednesday, giving it a high chance of approval in the German Parliament before national elections in September. In effect, the move is Germany\u2019s response to a barrage of fake news during last year\u2019s elections in the United States, with officials seeking to prevent a similar onslaught here.\"\n\n-- The Russians are waging a silent war against western institutions and values, but they also have a sense of humor: \u201cOn April Fools' Day, the Russian Foreign Ministry posted on its Facebook page a sendup of a Russian Embassy's answering machine,\u201d Carol Morello reports. \u201cThe recorded message could be heard in Russian and English: \u2018You have reached the Russian Embassy.

Trump\u2019s White House says the president wants Xi to feel comfortable for high-level talks in the relaxed environs of his Palm Beach club, a crown jewel in Trump\u2019s global array of holdings. But to Trump\u2019s harshest critics, the scene reeks of a corrupt blending of public power, personal profit, and undue access for wealthy club members.\u201d\n\n-- The Chinese side was initially hesitant to hold the meeting there: \u201cEven after seeing images of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's back-slapping sessions with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in February, Chinese officials thought the oceanfront, Spanish-style club in Palm Beach, Florida, lacked the symbolic significance of the White House itself,\u201d Reuters reports. \u201cThey thought, no, it has to be the White House, the symbolism of that,\u201d said a senior administration official. \u201cThey were ultimately convinced that this was worth doing. It\u2019s unusual because most foreigners realize that being invited to the president\u2019s personal place is a big deal.\u201d\n\nTrump and Kushner speak with manufacturing CEOs in the State Dining Room at the White House.

A guest at Tuesday\u2019s meeting [said]: \u2018Don Jr. said he is interested in running for office, such as governor of New York, but the position of mayor of New York would be less interesting to him.\u2019\u201d Campaigning alongside his father made him think about his future, with him saying, \u201cDo I want to be behind the scenes and be a mouthpiece and fight back against crazy liberal media? Maybe.\u201d Don Jr. joked that he \u201cmissed the intensity\u201d of the presidential campaign: \u201cGoing back to doing deals is boring after 18 months.

The same week, Trump hosted Fox News host Jeanine Pirro for dinner.

But the latest round has posed a unique set of challenges.\u201d\n\nTHE PUNDITS WEIGH IN:\n\n-- In a tongue-and-cheek column, the New York Times' Frank Bruni highlights the scope of Jared Kushner\u2019s to-do list \u2013 and what it says about the man who tasked him with such an impossible agenda: \u201cKushner\u2019s to-do list \u2026 contains the small, pesky item of brokering a durable truce between the Israelis and the Palestinians. \u2018If you can\u2019t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can,\u2019 Trump [told Kushner], who has absolutely no background in diplomacy. But he\u2019ll figure it out in those down moments. [And] take note: When you file your taxes in about two weeks, you can send them either to the [IRS] or to Kushner. He\u2019ll be chipping in with the auditing. I jest \u2026 But Kushner\u2019s many mandates aren\u2019t a laughing matter. They\u2019re a reflection of some of Trump\u2019s most unsettling traits as president, and Kushner is a symbol of his delusions. The president seems to see certain people as exempt from the laws of gravity, and he has accorded Kushner a place snug beside him in that pantheon. ... I\u2019m told by insiders that when Trump\u2019s long-shot campaign led to victory, he and Kushner became convinced not only that they\u2019d tapped into something that everybody was missing about America, but that they\u2019d tapped into something that everybody was missing about the two of them. Kushner was reborn with new powers, and to the heavens he ascended. It\u2019s a bird! It\u2019s a plane! It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cA raft of critics have recently come after Jared and Ivanka, alleging that they don\u2019t know a thing about policy (well, yeah) and that they\u2019re awash in ethical conflicts (like that matters),\u201d Yahoo News\u2019 Matt Bai writes. \u201cBut the problem with Washington\u2019s newest power couple is larger and more pervasive than any of that, and it illuminates the underlying darkness in this administration[:] Jared and Ivanka are accountable to exactly no one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this gets to the heart of my issue with Kushner and Ivanka, and with the Trump family acquisition of the White House generally. Basically, they\u2019ve decided all of a sudden that they\u2019d very much like to run the country for a spell, but they\u2019re not willing to sacrifice a \u2026 thing for the privilege. Public service is a playground to them, an accidental hobby. I\u2019d be willing to give Jared and Ivanka the benefit of the doubt \u2014 even absent any obvious humility or aptitude for their jobs \u2014 if they were willing to entirely divest themselves from competing interests, as Cabinet secretaries do. They won\u2019t, because it\u2019s not their way \u2026 To the Trump-Kushner axis, those people are just suckers who don\u2019t have what it takes to get rich, or at least to be born that way. The privileges they inherited are theirs to keep while they meddle around with policies that affect the rest of us. The honor, I guess, is all ours.\u201d\n\n-- Paul Waldman writes on the Plum Line Blog that Trump is already creating a \u201cworld of chaos\u201d: \u201cTrump is stepping up military action in places where the United States is already engaged, advocating huge increases in military spending, and simultaneously trying to gut the State Department. His secretary of state seems to be sleepwalking through his job, and is operating with barely any staff; it\u2019s obvious that the administration regards diplomacy as little more than a distraction. With regard to Syria, the administration\u2019s position is literally that 1) it\u2019s bad for Assad to kill civilians, but 2) we don\u2019t want anyone fleeing that war to come to America, and 3) it\u2019s all Obama\u2019s fault anyway. \u2026 It isn\u2019t even clear what goals the administration will be pursuing. What kind of world would Trump like to create? Your guess is as good as mine.

That\u2019s a complicated question,\u201d by Paul Farhi: \u201cIs Bill O\u2019Reilly too big to fire? The question wouldn\u2019t even have been asked just a few days ago. The most popular attraction on cable, O\u2019Reilly seemed to be Fox News Channel\u2019s indispensable man, the embodiment of its pugnacious identity. Now? The question is plausible, but the likely answer is unsatisfying: It depends \u2014 on multiple, unpredictable factors. Major companies \u2026 said they were \u2018suspending\u2019 their ads on the show until \u2014 well, it\u2019s not clear when \u2018until\u2019 is. And that could be one, if not the, decisive factor in \u2018The O\u2019Reilly Factor\u2019s\u2019 continued existence. A sustained and widespread advertiser shunning of O\u2019Reilly would be painful, undermining a key economic rationale for his program. [On the other hand] \u2026 advertising losses, if any, are just one part of the financial picture for Fox. The bulk of revenue for cable networks come from cable and satellite providers that deliver the programs to viewers. And this money flows from long-term contracts, unaffected by momentary controversies. In this regard, what O\u2019Reilly\u2019s audience does, rather than his advertisers, may be of greater importance to Fox\u2019s bottom line.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nMelania Trump and Jordanian Queen Rania Al-Abdullah visited an all-girls charter school, joined by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to promote empowerment of young women while also advancing the White House\u2019s interest in promoting alternatives to public schools.

The ad \u2026 originally targeted the German skin care company\u2019s followers in the Middle East. It was intended to promote Nivea\u2019s \u2018Invisible for Black and White\u2019 deodorant and depicted the back of a woman\u2019s head with long, wavy, dark hair that tumbled over an all-white outfit. Underneath the woman\u2019s locks was the slogan in all caps: \u2018WHITE IS PURITY.\u2019 The caption on Nivea\u2019s Facebook post read: \u2018Keep it clean, keep bright. Don\u2019t let anything ruin it, #Invisible.\u2019 The post was quickly condemned by those who saw it as promoting racist rhetoric. Still others appeared to praise the ad \u2014 for the same reasons. One white supremacist group commented, 'We enthusiastically support this new direction your company is taking. I\u2019m glad we can all agree that #WhiteIsPurity.'\" HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cTexas Man Arrested For Shooting At Perps Trying To Abduct His Fiance,\u201d from the Daily Caller: \u201cA Texas man was surprised to find himself in handcuffs after he thwarted a kidnapping attempt by unleashing a barrage of bullets at the attackers. When Jeremiah Morin, 35, of Spring, Texas, saw two masked kidnappers trying to snatch his fiance in the driveway of their Houston-area home, he drew his pistol and fired several shots at the men, causing them to flee. Montgomery Country sheriff\u2019s officers who responded to the incident arrested Morin, not the would-be kidnappers, for third-degree felony of \u201cdeadly conduct,\u201d the Dallas Morning News reported. Officers said he had fired his weapon \u2018in a complete disregard and reckless manner\u2019 and without consideration of whether there were innocent bystanders in nearby cars or houses. Morin and his fiance, Angela Estrada, were upset that police determined he was the one who committed a crime during the attempted kidnapping.\u201d\n\nDAYBOOK:\n\nAt the White House: Trump will participate in the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride before departing to West Palm Beach, Florida. In the evening, Trump and Melania will have dinner with President Xi Jinping and Madame Peng Liyuan of China. Mike Pence, meanwhile, will participate in the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride alongside Trump.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his closely watched annual letter to investors that the United States is an \"exceptional\" country, but he added that \"something is wrong\" in America. After spelling out a host of concerns regarding the challenges the country faces, he wrote: \"Making this list was an upsetting exercise.\u201d (Read his 45-page letter here.)\n\nNEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:\n\n-- A warm day, but lots of storming expected. Today\u2019s Capital Weather Gang forecasts: \u201cShowers and storms are likely through early afternoon, some of which could be heavy. The strongest cells could produce locally damaging winds and hail, with the highest risk of severe weather south of the District. An isolated tornado or two can\u2019t even be ruled out. Rain amounts are likely to average around a half-inch, but some areas could certainly top the inch mark. In the afternoon, the sun could peek out at times, but a few gusty showers, which could contain hail, may still cycle through. Highs reach the upper 60s to lower 70s.\u201d\n\n-- ICE officials arrested 82 people in Virginia, Maryland, and D.C. last week, as part of a five-day immigration sweep that immigration officials described as \u201croutine.\u201d The arrests included 68 people with previous criminal records, including a man they said was identified as an officer in command of a Somali organization known for its human rights abuses, rape, torture and killings.

Terry McAuliffe (D),\" Laura Vozzella and Gregory S. Schneider report: \u201c\u2018Hope springs eternal,\u2019 Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Fauquier) said as she encouraged fellow senators to rescue her bill, which would have allowed domestic-violence victims and others covered by protective orders to carry a concealed weapon without the usual permit or training. The Senate voted 23 to 17 in favor of the bill, falling short of the 27 votes needed to override the veto. It was like that all day. And it has been like that throughout McAuliffe\u2019s term, which began in January 2014 and has seen him veto more bills than any other Virginia governor.\"\n\n-- Faculty leaders at Howard University have no confidence in the school\u2019s top administrators. Citing concerns about financial problems, lack of transparency and failures of leadership, the faculty council passed a \u201cno confidence\u201d resolution related to both the president and provost. But some faculty say the vote took them by surprise and that it was procedurally invalid, and they question whether it is an accurate representation of the views of professors at the historically black university.
