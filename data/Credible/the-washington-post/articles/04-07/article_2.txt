Just last week, Tillerson said the Syrian people would decide the fate of Assad. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said removing Assad from power was no longer a priority.

How do the strikes impact Trump\u2019s relationship with Vladimir Putin?</strong></p> <p><strong>Russia retaliated this morning by pulling out of an agreement to minimize the risk of in-flight incidents between U.S. and Russian aircraft operating over Syria.</strong> \u201cThe Kremlin\u2019s decision to suspend the 2015 memorandum of understanding on the air operations immediately raised tensions in the skies over Syria,\u201d David Filipov reports from Moscow. \u201cPutin\u2019s spokesman said the risk of confrontation between aerial assets of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS and Russia has \u2018significantly increased.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>Though unclear on the broader strategy, Tillerson had tough words for Russia at Mar-a-Lago last night.</strong> He recalled the 2013 agreement with Syria to hand over its chemical stockpile, which called for Russia to monitor that Assad not cheat. \u201cClearly, Russia has failed in its responsibility on that commitment. Either Russia has been complicit or has been incompetent on its ability to deliver,\u201d said Tillerson, who was already scheduled to visit Moscow next week.</p> <p><strong>Despite extraordinary evidence to the contrary, Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed the Syrian government has no chemical weapons.</strong> He also said Putin sees the missile launches as an attempt to distract attention from the heavy civilian casualties caused by the U.S.-backed offensive to capture Mosul from ISIS.</p> <p><strong>A</strong> <strong>direct confrontation with Russia, even if accidental, is now more likely.</strong> This back-and-forth could prompt Trump to recalibrate his position toward Putin, potentially taking a more aggressive posture. The U.S. intervention, on the other, might also make Russia more willing to negotiate a deal to end the civil war and remove Assad.

Now he\u2019s part of one inside the White House</a>,\u201d by Ashley Parker, Robert Costa and Abby Phillip: </strong>\u201cStephen K. Bannon \u2014 the combative architect of the nationalistic strategy that delivered President Trump to the White House \u2014 now finds himself losing ground in an internecine battle within the West Wing that pits the \u2018Bannonites\u2019 against a growing and powerful faction of centrist financiers led by the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Less than 100 days into Trump\u2019s chaotic presidency, the White House is splintering over policy issues ranging from taxes to trade. The daily tumult has created an atmosphere of tension and panic around the president, leaving aides fearing for their jobs and cleaving former allies into rivals sniping at one another in the media. The infighting spilled into full view this week after Trump removed Bannon from the National Security Council\u2019s \u2018principals committee.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ashley, Bob and Abby \u2013 with assists from Tom Hamburger, Ros Helderman and Damian Paletta \u2013 interviewed more than 20 White House officials and people close to those in the administration for the story. </strong>Some choice nuggets from their piece:</p> <p><strong>\u201cFairly or unfairly, Bannon has borne the blame for several specific policy and political failures</strong>, including the scattershot drafting and implementation of Trump\u2019s first travel ban and the strategy and approach to dealing with the conservative House Freedom Caucus. The clash over control of a pro-Trump outside group also pitted Bannon, Republican super-donor Rebekah Mercer and her father, Robert, against Kushner. \u2026 And Bannon has felt the brunt of general frustrations surrounding the security council. In the early days of the administration, he elevated himself, without Trump\u2019s knowledge, to the principals committee, a move that infuriated the president. But the ultimate argument against him, said one person with knowledge of the situation, is that \u2018Bannon isn\u2019t making \u2018Dad\u2019 look good.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u201cBannon and his populist allies view Kushner\u2019s circle with growing suspicion, worrying aloud that the group \u2014 whom they dismiss as \u2018the Democrats,\u2019 \u2018the New Yorkers\u2019 or, simply, \u2018Goldman\u2019 \u2014 are pushing Trump in a \u2018Democrat Lite\u2019 direction. </strong>Kushner\u2019s allies, meanwhile, label Bannon\u2019s crowd as \u2018the Bannonites,\u2019 \u2018the Nationalists\u2019 or \u2018Breitbart.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u201cBannon, allies said, still has the president\u2019s ear, especially on key issues such as immigration, where he and Trump are in a complete \u2018mind meld.\u2019</strong> But the chief strategist has struggled to adjust to the more regimented mores of the White House. One friend said he hates attending meetings, bemoans the need to frequently wear suits, and finds the government bureaucracy stifling. While living in Los Angeles, Bannon would sometimes participate in Breitbart conference calls before showering and in a T-shirt or bathrobe.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u201cSome of those who resent Kushner\u2019s rising power have compared him to Icarus, the youth in Greek mythology who flew too close to the sun and melted his wings.</strong> <strong>But because Kushner holds so much clout, many of his rivals fear bad-mouthing him and train their ire on his deputies instead.</strong> \u2018When you complain about Gary or Dina, you\u2019re really complaining about Jared and what he\u2019s doing, because you\u2019re not able to complain about Jared around here,\u2019 said one senior White House official. \u2026 Another administration official warned that Bannon was playing \u201ca dangerous game\u201d because it is \u201cnot a smart strategy to go up against the president and his family. That\u2019s a game Steve will never win.\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- Bannon uses other names for Kushner, as well. </strong>\u201cHe has called the president\u2019s son-in-law <strong>a \u2018cuck\u2019 and a \u2018globalist\u2019</strong> \u2026 according to several Trump administration officials,\"&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/06/steve-bannon-calls-jared-kushner-a-cuck-and-globalist-behind-his-back.html\">The Daily Beast\u2019s Asawin Suebsaeng</a>&nbsp;reports. \"One official said Bannon has lately complained about Kushner trying to \u2018shiv him and push him out the door\u2019 and likened him to a fifth column in the White House.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- The New York Times also looks at the Bannon vs. Kushner tensions on their front page. </strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/stephen-bannon-white-house.html\">From Maggie Haberman, Jeremy Peters and Peter Baker:</a> Thick with tension, the conversation this week between Bannon and Kushner had deteriorated to the point of breakdown. \u201cFinally, Mr. Bannon identified why they could not compromise. \u2018Here\u2019s the reason there\u2019s no middle ground,\u2019 Mr. Bannon growled. \u2018You\u2019re a Democrat.\u2019 \u2026 At different moments, Mr. Trump has given conflicting impressions of his preferences. He has privately scorned the coverage of Mr. Kushner\u2019s recent high-profile trip to Iraq, according to two people who spoke with him, and questioned the need for his son-in-law\u2019s newly created office to overhaul the government. At other points, he has been dismissive of Mr. Bannon, curtly telling him he is not needed at this meeting or that\u2026</p> <p><strong>\u201cAlthough they were once at odds and still come from vastly different vantage points, Mr. Bannon has also maintained an alliance of convenience lately with Reince Priebus, the chief of staff closely associated with the Republican Party establishment. </strong>In recent weeks, as Mr. Bannon has felt increasingly frustrated, Mr. Priebus has several times bolstered the chief strategist in discussions with the president, according to people with direct knowledge of the talks. In turn, Mr. Bannon has gone out of his way to praise his onetime rival\u2019s performance\u2026</p> <p><strong>\u201cMr. Priebus remains in a hot spot. Mr. Trump is fond of asking visitors, \u2018How do you think Reince is doing?\u2019</strong> and he expressed anger at the collapse of the health care overhaul, telling a longtime associate last week that he believed that Mr. Priebus was partly to blame.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- Trump is now considering a broad shakeup that could include the replacement of Priebus and the departure of Bannon, aides and advisers <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/exclusive-trump-eyes-new-chief-of-staff-house-leader-on-short-list-2349015716.html\">tell Axios\u2019s Mike Allen</a> this morning: </strong>\u201cA top aide to Trump said he's contemplating major changes, but that the situation is very fluid and the timing uncertain: \u2018Things are happening, but it's very unclear the president's willing to pull that trigger.\u2019\u201d <strong>Unnamed insiders tell Mike that there are four people on the short list to replace Reince as chief of staff:</strong></p> <ul> <li>House Majority Leader <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong></li> <li><strong>Wayne Berman </strong>of Blackstone Group, who was an Assistant Secretary of Commerce under President George H.W.

They [married in 1983] and moved to East Germany \u2026 where her husband was a KGB spy. But as Vladimir [began his reign] in Moscow, Lyudmila was seen less and less in public. Wild rumors in the Russian press suggested that he had packed her off to a monastery. Since then, Russians have heard little about Lyudmila \u2026 But many ordinary citizens remained fascinated by her, eager to know what happened to the woman who may have gotten closer to Putin than anyone else. Now, almost four years later, details about Lyudmila\u2019s new life are emerging. And rather than turning up at a remote monastery, she appears to be planning a lavish life at a European villa, with a new husband 20 years her junior. These new details offer not only a glimpse into the notoriously private world of Putin\u2019s family, barely acknowledged in official accounts and the subject of tabloid gossip, but also a hint of the wealth that critics say the Russian president and those in his inner circle have acquired over recent years.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- \u201c</strong><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russian-media-wrongly-accused-a-muslim-man-of-the-st-petersburg-bombing-it-nearly-ruined-his-life/2017/04/06/6dc60e4a-1ac5-11e7-8598-9a99da559f9e_story.html?utm_term=.9227a922f590\"><strong>Russian media wrongly accused a Muslim man of the St. Petersburg bombing.

TV news stations and Russian online sites [rushed to] broadcast grainy security footage of the man \u2026 <strong>Except he wasn\u2019t the terrorist.</strong> It was Ilyas Nikitin \u2026 a former army captain who fought Islamic separatists as a Russian officer in Chechnya and later converted to Islam. \u2018This case has deeply complicated my life,\u2019 Nikitin [said]. \u2026 Since the bombing, he said, he had been pulled off a flight because other passengers recognized him as the suspected bomber and was told he could lose his job because of the investigation. The story is a cautionary tale of the speed with which digital sleuthing, instant Twitter news updates, and racial profiling can yield devastating consequences for their targets.

Since a gifts scandal engulfed former governor Robert F. McDonnell (R) in 2013, Virginia\u2019s legislature has moved to tighten the state\u2019s notoriously lax ethics and campaign-finance rules year after year. But loopholes remain. And the Republicans who control both chambers in Richmond have been flatly opposed to bans on personal use, arguing that restrictions would trip up even honest public servants. Gillespie\u2019s proposals were part of a broader ethics and government-transparency plan he unveiled in the company of the outgoing and incoming speakers of Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates \u2014 a powerful signal that Gillespie\u2019s personal-use ban would fare better than the one Gov.

"the-washington-post", "text": "With Breanne Deppisch\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Was Donald Trump\u2019s attack on Syria the opening salvo of a broader campaign to topple Bashar al-Assad? Will Congress get a say? Is it really possible that Democrats are backing up the president more than some of his core supporters?\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to launch 59 cruise missiles at an airfield early Friday in retaliation for a chemical attack that killed scores of civilians ratchets up the intensity of a complicated regional conflict, increases the risk of clashes with Russia, and will generate a vigorous debate about the U.S. role.\n\nThis could play out in a myriad of ways. Here are 13 unknowns at this hour:\n\n1. Does the president plan to deploy more than just Tomahawks?\n\nTrump described the strike as \u201ctargeted\u201d during a three-minute address from Mar-a-Lago, where he was meeting with the leader of China. \u201cIt is in the vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a briefing for reporters afterward, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described it as a \u201cproportional\u201d response. National security adviser H.R. McMaster emphasized efforts to minimize the risks of accidentally breaching a supply of sarin nerve agent.\n\nThe attack also involved only missiles that can be launched from Navy destroyers up to 1,000 miles away from the target. Fighter planes would have had to contend with Syrian air defenses and potentially more advanced types of surface-to-air missiles provided by Russia. These might have put the lives of U.S. pilots in danger. The missiles have been used successfully since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, but our Checkpoint blog notes that Tomahawks also have less explosive yield than larger bombs carried by manned aircraft.\n\n2. Does Trump fully grasp the risks he has just taken?\n\n\u201cWithin the administration, some officials urged immediate action against Assad, warning against what one described as \u2018paralysis through analysis.\u2019 But others were concerned about second- and third-order effects,\u201d according to Pentagon reporters Dan Lamothe, Missy Ryan and Thomas Gibbons-Neff. \u201cThe attack may put hundreds of American troops now stationed in Syria in greater danger. They are advising local forces in advance of a major assault on the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital.\u201d\n\nLaunching missiles was the easy part. \u201cThe big problem is what comes next,\u201d writes Greg Jaffe. \u201cThe military had been preparing options for a strike against [Assad] since well before 2013, when the Syrian dictator killed more than 1,000 of his own people in a devastating nerve gas attack. The biggest difference between when Barack Obama last threatened airstrikes against Assad and today is that the risks of widening the conflict are much greater. \u2026 Today, Russian troops are intermingled with Syrian forces, and any strike on a Syrian military target could also produce Russian military casualties.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump listens this morning during a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago. (Jim WatsonAFP/Getty Images)\n\n3. What is Trump\u2019s goal with intervention? No one from the administration has yet articulated what they want the end game to be. Just last week, Tillerson said the Syrian people would decide the fate of Assad. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said removing Assad from power was no longer a priority. White House press secretary Sean Spicer earlier this week defended that position by saying it\u2019s necessary to accept the \u201cpolitical reality\u201d on the ground.\n\nAt his briefing last night, Tillerson confusingly warned against reading too much into the missile attack. \u201cThis clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for,\u201d the secretary said. \u201cI would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or posture relative to our military activities in Syria today. There has been no change in that status.\u201d What exactly does he mean by that? Is it still not a U.S. priority to take out Assad? Spicer cut off questioning before anyone could follow up.\n\n4. What does this mean for the U.S. fight against ISIS? As Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it: \u201cTrump has said repeatedly that his objective in Syria is to defeat ISIS. Last night's strike was aimed at a different objective. President Trump needs to articulate a coherent strategy for dealing with this complex conflict, because the consequences of a misstep are grave.\u201d\n\n5. How do the strikes impact Trump\u2019s relationship with Vladimir Putin?\n\nRussia retaliated this morning by pulling out of an agreement to minimize the risk of in-flight incidents between U.S. and Russian aircraft operating over Syria. \u201cThe Kremlin\u2019s decision to suspend the 2015 memorandum of understanding on the air operations immediately raised tensions in the skies over Syria,\u201d David Filipov reports from Moscow. \u201cPutin\u2019s spokesman said the risk of confrontation between aerial assets of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS and Russia has \u2018significantly increased.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough unclear on the broader strategy, Tillerson had tough words for Russia at Mar-a-Lago last night. He recalled the 2013 agreement with Syria to hand over its chemical stockpile, which called for Russia to monitor that Assad not cheat. \u201cClearly, Russia has failed in its responsibility on that commitment. Either Russia has been complicit or has been incompetent on its ability to deliver,\u201d said Tillerson, who was already scheduled to visit Moscow next week.\n\nDespite extraordinary evidence to the contrary, Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed the Syrian government has no chemical weapons. He also said Putin sees the missile launches as an attempt to distract attention from the heavy civilian casualties caused by the U.S.-backed offensive to capture Mosul from ISIS.\n\nA direct confrontation with Russia, even if accidental, is now more likely. This back-and-forth could prompt Trump to recalibrate his position toward Putin, potentially taking a more aggressive posture. The U.S. intervention, on the other, might also make Russia more willing to negotiate a deal to end the civil war and remove Assad. You never know.\n\n6. Will Iran wade more deeply into the Syrian conflict now? Along with Russia, Tehran has long backed Assad and denounced the U.S. airstrikes. \u201cThe Shiite theocracy\u2019s state news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman describing the attacks as \u2018dangerous, destructive and a violation of international laws to use it as an excuse to take unilateral actions,\u2019\u201d Sudarsan Raghavan reports from Cairo. The question is what they do about it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the bombings from Jerusalem, naturally, as did the Saudis in Riyadh and the Turkish president\u2019s spokesman in Istanbul.\n\nIn Europe, despite their frosty relationships with the new U.S. president, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande backed Trump\u2019s actions. Britain also offered backing but said it would not participate if asked. (In 2013, the House of Commons blocked a request from David Cameron to support the U.S. effort.)\n\n7. Will the U.S. Congress vote to authorize force?\n\nNancy Pelosi put out a press release this morning calling on Speaker Paul Ryan to cancel the Easter recess and call the House back into session to debate an \u201cAuthorization for the Use of Military Force\u201d for the action taken in Syria. Several rank-and-file Democrats joined her.\n\nRyan spokeswoman AshLee Strong responded that there are no changes to the schedule. She pointed to Ryan's statement last night. \u201cThis action was appropriate and just,\u201d the speaker said.\n\nMitch McConnell, also offering support for Trump\u2019s decision, scheduled a briefing for all 100 senators on the attack later today. Aides say the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Joseph Dunford, will speak at the closed-door session.\n\nSeveral prominent Republican senators called for Congress to take up the issue immediately:\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah): \u201cIf the United States is to increase our use of military force in Syria, we should follow the Constitution and seek the proper authorization from Congress. President Trump should make his case in front of the American people and allow their elected representatives to debate the benefits and risks of further Middle East intervention to our national security interests. I stand ready to stay in Washington, or come back to Washington, in order to properly consider any further military action and the national security interests of the American people.\u201d\n\n(R-Utah): \u201cIf the United States is to increase our use of military force in Syria, we should follow the Constitution and seek the proper authorization from Congress. President Trump should make his case in front of the American people and allow their elected representatives to debate the benefits and risks of further Middle East intervention to our national security interests. I stand ready to stay in Washington, or come back to Washington, in order to properly consider any further military action and the national security interests of the American people.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.): \"While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked. The President needs Congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate. Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different.\"\n\n(R-Ky.): \"While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked. The President needs Congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate. Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different.\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.): \u201cAny military action in Syria must be justified as protecting the vital national security interests of America \u2026 and I look forward to our Commander-in-Chief making the case to Congress and the American people how we should do so in the days ahead. \u201d\n\n(R-Tex.): \u201cAny military action in Syria must be justified as protecting the vital national security interests of America \u2026 and \u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.): \u201cThe president should propose to Congress a comprehensive strategy to protect American interests from a humanitarian crisis that threatens to destabilize our regional allies and create vacuums for jihadi sanctuaries.\"\n\nSeveral House Republicans expressed a similar position:\n\nGood to finally have decisive leadership in White House. But if POTUS wants sustained military campaign, come to Congress for authorization. \u2014 Congressman Rod Blum (@RepRodBlum) April 7, 2017\n\nAirstrikes are an act of war. Atrocities in Syria cannot justify departure from Constitution, which vests in Congress power to commence war. \u2014 Justin Amash (@justinamash) April 7, 2017\n\nSenate Democrats also want to take up the issue. This has long been a top issue for Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic nominee for vice president, and he reiterated that:\n\nPresident waging military action against Syria without a vote of Congress? Unconstitutional. \u2014 Senator Tim Kaine (@timkaine) April 7, 2017\n\nMany on both sides are pointing to these Trump tweets from four years ago, when he insisted Obama go to Congress before striking Syria:\n\nWhat will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2013\n\nThe President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2013\n\n8. How many Democrats give air cover to Trump? There\u2019s been reflective, knee-jerk opposition from the left to pretty much everything Trump has done since he took office in January, but this is war. Will some leaders of the opposition rally around the flag and the commander in chief?\n\nHillary Clinton supported a no-fly zone over Syria during the campaign last year, putting her in a more hawkish place than President Barack Obama. Speaking in New York yesterday, she called on Trump to take out Assad\u2019s air force. \"Assad has an air force, and that air force is the cause of most of these civilian deaths as we have seen over the years and as we saw again in the last few days,\" the former secretary of said at a \"Women in the World\" summit, per CNN. \"And I really believe that we should have and still should take out his air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.\" She added that if she were in power, she would tell Russia they were either \u201cwith us or against us\u201d on the no-fly zone. \"It is time,\" she said, \"the Russians were afraid of us because we were going to stand up for the rights, the human rights, the dignity and the future of the Syrian people.\"\n\nPelosi, despite calling for recess to be canceled, described the strike as \u201ca proportional response to the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons.\u201d She said she is mostly worried about escalation from here/\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor this morning: \u201cMaking sure that Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do. It is now incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a coherent strategy and consult with Congress.\u201d\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the No. 2 in Senate Democratic leadership, also offered measured support: \u201cMy preliminary briefing by the White House indicated that this was a measured response to the Syrian nerve gas atrocity. Any further action will require close scrutiny by Congress, and any escalation beyond airstrikes or missile strikes will require engaging the American people in that decision.\u201d\n\nSen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who is up for reelection next year, also offered support:\n\nI support the admin\u2019s strike on the air base that launched the chemical attack. I hope this teaches Assad not to use chemical weapons again. \u2014 Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson) April 7, 2017\n\nRubio speaks during a press conference yesterday, with a photograph of one of the victims of the gas attack in Syria. (AP)\n\n9. How many conservatives who opposed Obama\u2019s effort to bomb Syria now support Trump doing the same? How will they justify their flip-flops?\n\nSen. Marco Rubio voted against authorizing the U.S. to take action against Assad four years ago. He\u2019s defended his vote by saying, Obama \"was proposing what they called pinprick strikes, basically a symbolic strike to send a message, but not backed up by a clear plan.\u201d\n\nLast night, the Florida senator praised Trump for what could arguably be called a pinprick strike. \u201cTonight's actions show the days of being able to attack with impunity when it comes to Assad are over,\" Rubio said on CNN.\n\n\"Be sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished\" Proverbs 11:21 #SyriaChemicalAttack \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) April 7, 2017\n\nAbout 100 House Republicans signed a letter in the summer of 2013 that suggested it would be unconstitutional for Obama to order any military response to Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons without getting congressional approval first. Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney has filled his Twitter timeline with examples of GOP lawmakers who signed that letter but now praise Trump for being decisive:\n\nHomeland Security chairman @RepMcCaul -- who called unilateral action unconstitutional in 2013 -- weighs in with praise for Trump's strike. pic.twitter.com/RErn5yrScg \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) April 7, 2017\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said this of Obama\u2019s effort in 2013:\n\nStill no explanation of steps 2, 3, 4, etc. and consequences of going to war in Syria. I am still a NO. \u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) September 11, 2013\n\nHe reacted this way last night:\n\nGod bless the USA! \u2014 Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) April 7, 2017\n\nRep. Martha Roby (R-Ala.) said this in 2013:\n\nI remain deeply concerned that the use of military force in #Syria at this time could have serious negative consequences for our country. \u2014 Rep. Martha Roby (@RepMarthaRoby) September 10, 2013\n\nAnd this last night:\n\nI applaud @POTUS for his decisiveness in responding to Assad's brutal chemical weapons attack. \u2014 Rep. Martha Roby (@RepMarthaRoby) April 7, 2017\n\n10. How effectively will Trump sell his own reversal on airstrikes? The president has said seeing images of lifeless children galvanized him to change his mind about Syria. But there were painfully similar, horrifying photos three years ago as he tweeted these messages:\n\nPresident Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your \"powder\" for another (and more important) day! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2013\n\nLet the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2013\n\nNow that Obama\u2019s poll numbers are in tailspin \u2013 watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2012\n\nBe prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2013\n\n11. Was the president really a hawk in dove\u2019s clothing all along?\n\n\u201cTrump abruptly sheds his noninterventionist fa\u00e7ade\u201d is how Aaron Blake wrote up last night\u2019s news. \u201cIt's likely that the noninterventionist promises Trump made during the campaign helped him by allaying some of the greatest fears about making him president and commander in chief. Arguably his biggest liability was that people \u2014 even many supporters \u2014 believed he lacked the proper temperament to be president. The prospect of the hotheaded, itchy-Twitter-fingered reality TV star having access to the nuclear codes was an attack ad that wrote itself. But Trump's promises to stay out of the Middle East and focus on the homeland mitigated that line of attack. Voters were led to believe his foreign policy wouldn't be on the same hair trigger that everything else about him seemed to be, and it gave them license to instead focus on what a businessman president could do for the economy. Yet here we are. Less than three months into his presidency, Trump has now responded to a not-unprecedented set of circumstances in Syria with an unprecedented degree of force and provocation.\u201d\n\nFrom the former CIA officer who ran for president as a conservative alternative to Trump last year:\n\nI support stopping Assad's atrocities, but it's unnerving that Trump changed his position on striking Syria 180 degrees in only 24 hours. \u2014 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) April 7, 2017\n\nA good question from a Post foreign affairs columnist:\n\nSo is Trump now a liberal humanitarian interventionalist or a neocon unilateralist? Discuss. \u2014 Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) April 7, 2017\n\n12. Will some of Trump\u2019s diehard supporters from the fever swamps of the alt-right turn on him because of Syria?\n\n\u201cAcross the Internet, an alternative take on the horrific attack \u2026 has begun to spread,\u201d Adam Taylor reports. \u201cIt was a \u2018false flag,\u2019 the theory goes, designed to trick Trump into intervening more forcefully in the Syrian war. Those spreading this theory are often closely linked to the \u2018alt-right,\u2019 a small, far right movement whose members are known for espousing racist, anti-Semitic and sexist points of view. One of the most notorious figures associated with the movement, Mike Cernovich, posted tweets on Wednesday claiming that the gut-wrenching footage of victims of the attack had been faked. Cernovich's messages about Syria have found an audience. They have been retweeted several thousand times by his 245,000 followers \u2014 even though the California-based Internet personality acknowledged that he didn't know much about the situation. \u2026 Just in the past week, both Donald Trump Jr. and White House counselor Kellyanne Conway have praised Cernovich \u2014 Trump's son suggested that Cernovich should win a Pulitzer.\u201d\n\nInfoWars and WikiLeaks, which have boosted Trump, are also getting in on the fringe and unfounded conspiracy theories that this was all staged to trick Trump into going to war in the Middle East.\n\nThis guy works with InfoWars, the site run by Alex Jones:\n\nI guess Trump wasn't \"Putin's puppet\" after all, he was just another deep state/Neo-Con puppet.\n\n\n\nI'm officially OFF the Trump train. \u2014 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 7, 2017\n\nIt's been fun lads, but the fun is over. I'll be focusing my efforts on Le Pen, who tried to warn Trump against this disaster. \u2014 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 7, 2017\n\nAnother alt-right Trump supporter, who goes by the pen named Baked Alaska, added:\n\nPeople praising the Syria attack:\n\n\n\n-Hillary\n\n-McCain\n\n-Lindsay Graham\n\n-Paul Ryan\n\n-Leftists\n\n\n\nPeople against the attack:\n\n\n\n-Real Trump Supporters \u2014 Baked Alaska\u2122 (@bakedalaska) April 7, 2017\n\nSeveral other well-known Trump allies are publicly expressing frustration:\n\nTrump campaigned on not getting involved in Mideast. Said it always helps our enemies & creates more refugees. Then he saw a picture on TV. \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) April 7, 2017\n\nMissiles flying. Rubio's happy. McCain ecstatic. Hillary's on board. A complete policy change in 48 hrs. \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) April 7, 2017\n\nRaytheon McDonnell Douglas manufactures the Tomahawk cruise missiles. Cost $1.59M each. \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) April 7, 2017\n\nNigel Farage, the champion of Brexit who traveled the country with Trump during the campaign, spoke out against Trump\u2019s first major military decision. Perhaps Farage will turn out to be a bigger fan of Putin, whose propaganda television network RT he often appears on, than Trump:\n\nMany Trump voters will be worried about this military intervention. Where will it end? \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) April 7, 2017\n\n13. Finally, what impact, if any, will military intervention have on the debate about Trump\u2019s refugee ban?\n\n\u201cYears of previous attempts at changing Assad's behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically,\u201d Trump said in his three-minute speech last night. \u201cAs a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies.\u201d\n\nAsked after the speech whether the White House approach to the refugee crisis will change because of the military action, the national security adviser replied: \u201cNo, that wasn't discussed as any part of the deliberations.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats are focusing on the refugee ban as they react to the missile strikes. \u201cPresident Assad's vicious brutality demands a response. But \u2026 any strategy that ignores the refugees fleeing this unimaginable terror is a half-step at best,\u201d said Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.). Another member of the Bay State delegation added:\n\nSo @POTUS cares enough about the Syrian people to launch 50 Tomahawks but not enough to let the victims of Assad find refuge & freedom here. \u2014 Seth Moulton (@sethmoulton) April 7, 2017\n\nHollywood celebrities have zeroed in on the refugees, as well:\n\nMr. Sulu from Star Trek:\n\nTrump on Syria: \"No child of God should suffer such horror.\" BUT NO WAY, NOPE. THEY CAN'T COME HERE. \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) April 7, 2017\n\nThe star of the musical group Fifth Harmony:\n\nMoved enough by innocent casualties to excuse bombing them, but not enough to accept refugees. War is a game of hypocrisy & greed #Syria \u2014 Lauren Jauregui (@LaurenJauregui) April 7, 2017\n\nAnd the host of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d:\n\nIt's sad that politicians can't find money for education, clean water or healthcare but they can spend millions to \"send a message to Syria\" \u2014 Trevor Noah (@Trevornoah) April 7, 2017\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nThe rear of a truck protrudes after it crashed into a department store in Stockholm. (Anders Wiklund/TT News Agency via AP)\n\n-- A stolen truck plowed into a department store Friday in central Stockholm, killing at least three people and touching off a major manhunt after what the country\u2019s prime minister described as a likely terrorist attack. From Griff Witte and Heba Habib: \u201cPolice said the driver apparently escaped and was the subject of a rapidly widening search. Heavily armed officers patrolled the streets and police helicopters buzzed overhead. Authorities also imposed sweeping security measures, including closing off streets and shutting down the city\u2019s transit system in lockdown scenes recalling recent terrorist strikes in London and St. Petersburg.

It\u2019s the lowest gain in nearly a decade and down from 219,000 in February. Ana Swanson reports: \u201cScott Anderson, chief economist of Bank of the West, called the report a \u2018bit of a disappointment,\u2019 but added \u2018I think it\u2019s more of a blip than a start of a new trend.\u2019 Anderson said that winter storms could have subtracted as many as 60,000 jobs from March payrolls, especially in weather-sensitive industries like construction, retail and leisure and hospitality. [Meanwhile], the unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent in February, while the broadest measure of unemployment -- which counts so-called discouraged workers who have given up looking for work, as well as those who are employed part-time but would like to be full time -- also fell sharply, to 8.9 percent.\u201d (Read more here.)\n\n-- President Trump\u2019s company and D.C. chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s have settled a nearly two-year-old legal dispute stemming from the chef\u2019s decision to shelve plans to open a restaurant in Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel following Trump\u2019s controversial immigration rhetoric.

Tweets from the account -- @ALT_uscis -- indicate that it is run by someone who is an employee of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Free speech advocates said the DHS order appeared to be the first time the government has attempted to use its powers to expose an anonymous critic -- a development that, if successful, would have a \"grave chilling effect on the speech of that account\" as well as other accounts critical of the U.S. government, Twitter said.

(New York Times)\n\nFIVE FRESH STORIES ON WEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- \u201cBannon wants a war on Washington. Now he\u2019s part of one inside the White House,\u201d by Ashley Parker, Robert Costa and Abby Phillip: \u201cStephen K. Bannon \u2014 the combative architect of the nationalistic strategy that delivered President Trump to the White House \u2014 now finds himself losing ground in an internecine battle within the West Wing that pits the \u2018Bannonites\u2019 against a growing and powerful faction of centrist financiers led by the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Less than 100 days into Trump\u2019s chaotic presidency, the White House is splintering over policy issues ranging from taxes to trade. The daily tumult has created an atmosphere of tension and panic around the president, leaving aides fearing for their jobs and cleaving former allies into rivals sniping at one another in the media. The infighting spilled into full view this week after Trump removed Bannon from the National Security Council\u2019s \u2018principals committee.\u2019\u201d\n\nAshley, Bob and Abby \u2013 with assists from Tom Hamburger, Ros Helderman and Damian Paletta \u2013 interviewed more than 20 White House officials and people close to those in the administration for the story. Some choice nuggets from their piece:\n\n\u201cFairly or unfairly, Bannon has borne the blame for several specific policy and political failures, including the scattershot drafting and implementation of Trump\u2019s first travel ban and the strategy and approach to dealing with the conservative House Freedom Caucus. The clash over control of a pro-Trump outside group also pitted Bannon, Republican super-donor Rebekah Mercer and her father, Robert, against Kushner. \u2026 And Bannon has felt the brunt of general frustrations surrounding the security council. In the early days of the administration, he elevated himself, without Trump\u2019s knowledge, to the principals committee, a move that infuriated the president. But the ultimate argument against him, said one person with knowledge of the situation, is that \u2018Bannon isn\u2019t making \u2018Dad\u2019 look good.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBannon and his populist allies view Kushner\u2019s circle with growing suspicion, worrying aloud that the group \u2014 whom they dismiss as \u2018the Democrats,\u2019 \u2018the New Yorkers\u2019 or, simply, \u2018Goldman\u2019 \u2014 are pushing Trump in a \u2018Democrat Lite\u2019 direction. Kushner\u2019s allies, meanwhile, label Bannon\u2019s crowd as \u2018the Bannonites,\u2019 \u2018the Nationalists\u2019 or \u2018Breitbart.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBannon, allies said, still has the president\u2019s ear, especially on key issues such as immigration, where he and Trump are in a complete \u2018mind meld.\u2019 But the chief strategist has struggled to adjust to the more regimented mores of the White House. One friend said he hates attending meetings, bemoans the need to frequently wear suits, and finds the government bureaucracy stifling. While living in Los Angeles, Bannon would sometimes participate in Breitbart conference calls before showering and in a T-shirt or bathrobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of those who resent Kushner\u2019s rising power have compared him to Icarus, the youth in Greek mythology who flew too close to the sun and melted his wings. But because Kushner holds so much clout, many of his rivals fear bad-mouthing him and train their ire on his deputies instead. \u2018When you complain about Gary or Dina, you\u2019re really complaining about Jared and what he\u2019s doing, because you\u2019re not able to complain about Jared around here,\u2019 said one senior White House official. \u2026 Another administration official warned that Bannon was playing \u201ca dangerous game\u201d because it is \u201cnot a smart strategy to go up against the president and his family. That\u2019s a game Steve will never win.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Bannon uses other names for Kushner, as well. \u201cHe has called the president\u2019s son-in-law a \u2018cuck\u2019 and a \u2018globalist\u2019 \u2026 according to several Trump administration officials,\" The Daily Beast\u2019s Asawin Suebsaeng reports. \"One official said Bannon has lately complained about Kushner trying to \u2018shiv him and push him out the door\u2019 and likened him to a fifth column in the White House.\u201d\n\n-- The New York Times also looks at the Bannon vs. Kushner tensions on their front page. From Maggie Haberman, Jeremy Peters and Peter Baker: Thick with tension, the conversation this week between Bannon and Kushner had deteriorated to the point of breakdown. \u201cFinally, Mr. Bannon identified why they could not compromise. \u2018Here\u2019s the reason there\u2019s no middle ground,\u2019 Mr. Bannon growled. \u2018You\u2019re a Democrat.\u2019 \u2026 At different moments, Mr. Trump has given conflicting impressions of his preferences. He has privately scorned the coverage of Mr. Kushner\u2019s recent high-profile trip to Iraq, according to two people who spoke with him, and questioned the need for his son-in-law\u2019s newly created office to overhaul the government. At other points, he has been dismissive of Mr. Bannon, curtly telling him he is not needed at this meeting or that\u2026\n\n\u201cAlthough they were once at odds and still come from vastly different vantage points, Mr. Bannon has also maintained an alliance of convenience lately with Reince Priebus, the chief of staff closely associated with the Republican Party establishment. In recent weeks, as Mr. Bannon has felt increasingly frustrated, Mr. Priebus has several times bolstered the chief strategist in discussions with the president, according to people with direct knowledge of the talks. In turn, Mr. Bannon has gone out of his way to praise his onetime rival\u2019s performance\u2026\n\n\u201cMr. Priebus remains in a hot spot. Mr. Trump is fond of asking visitors, \u2018How do you think Reince is doing?\u2019 and he expressed anger at the collapse of the health care overhaul, telling a longtime associate last week that he believed that Mr. Priebus was partly to blame.\u201d\n\n-- Trump is now considering a broad shakeup that could include the replacement of Priebus and the departure of Bannon, aides and advisers tell Axios\u2019s Mike Allen this morning: \u201cA top aide to Trump said he's contemplating major changes, but that the situation is very fluid and the timing uncertain: \u2018Things are happening, but it's very unclear the president's willing to pull that trigger.\u2019\u201d Unnamed insiders tell Mike that there are four people on the short list to replace Reince as chief of staff:\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy\n\nWayne Berman of Blackstone Group, who was an Assistant Secretary of Commerce under President George H.W.

On a given day, the line outside Trump's Oval Office can stretch to dozens of people, including aides, diplomats and outside visitors -- some scheduled to meet with the President and others brought in on a whim.\"\n\nGONE NUCLEAR:\n\n-- The U.S. Senate confirmed Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court, voting 54-45. He is expected to be sworn-in during the coming days, allowing him to join the high court for the final weeks of its term. (Ed O'Keefe and Robert Barnes)\n\n-- Republicans cleared the way for Gorsuch yesterday by changing the rules of the Senate. From Ed O\u2019Keefe and Sean Sullivan: \u201cThe long-anticipated rules change now means that all presidential nominees for executive branch positions and the federal courts need only a simple-majority vote to be confirmed by senators. The GOP decision to ram through the rules change is also likely to further divide an increasingly partisan Senate.\u201d\n\nThis is a huge political win for Mitch McConnell: \u201cAs he left the Senate chamber, the usually reserved McConnell flashed a bit of showmanship \u2014 he high-fived some colleagues, awkwardly embraced Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and gave a thumbs-up to photographers.\u201d\n\nThere is no going back. The Rubicon has been crossed. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), among other Democrats, signaled that they would not necessarily support restoring Senate traditions if they retake control of the chamber. \u201cWe can\u2019t unilaterally disarm,\u201d he said.\n\n-- \u201cThe Gorsuch vote makes the McConnell-Schumer relationship look bad. It might get better,\u201d by Paul Kane: Chuck Schumer rattled off questions to the chamber\u2019s presiding officer before yesterday\u2019s rule change, designed to embarrass Republicans. A few feet to his right, McConnell sat silently, giggling to himself at one point. \u201cAs relationships go, the new Democratic leader and the longtime GOP leader have gotten off to one of the worst starts of the last 40 years in the Senate. Several Democrats, including Schumer, even voted against the confirmation of McConnell\u2019s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. \u2018If they were looking for 10 different ways to get off to a bad start, this would be 11,\u2019 Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a close friend to both leaders, said after Thursday\u2019s confrontation.\u201d\n\nBut, but, but: \u201cAlexander, along with several other senators and senior advisers, suggested that the two leaders still have the chance to build the kind of relationship that can salvage some of the glory the Senate lost over the past decade of partisan gamesmanship. There\u2019s little time before their first big test, just four weeks away, when the legislation that funds the government is set to expire. As they\u2019ve publicly fought over Gorsuch, McConnell and Schumer have privately led negotiations aiming for a three-way deal among House leaders and Trump officials for a large bipartisan funding outline for the rest of 2018. The leaders had a productive face-to-face meeting this week, according to one Senate aide, and Alexander said he is optimistic that deal will be completed this month.\u201d\n\nThen-CIA Director John Brennan testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January. (Cliff Owen/AP)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- The C.I.A. told senior lawmakers in classified briefings last summer that it had evidence of a Russian effort to help elect Trump as president -- a finding that did not emerge publicly until after his victory months later. The New York Times\u2019 Eric Lichtblau reports: \u201cThe briefings indicate that intelligence officials had evidence of Russia\u2019s intentions to help Mr. Trump much earlier in the presidential campaign than previously thought. The briefings also reveal a critical split last summer between the C.I.A. and counterparts at the F.B.I., where a number of senior officials continued to believe through last fall that Russia\u2019s cyberattacks were aimed only at disrupting America\u2019s political system, and not at getting Mr. Trump elected \u2026 The former officials said that in late August \u2014 10 weeks before the election \u2014 John O. Brennan, then the C.I.A. director, was so concerned about increasing evidence of Russia\u2019s election meddling that he began a series of urgent, individual briefings for eight top members of Congress, some of them on secure phone lines while they were on their summer break\u2026\n\n\u201cIn the August briefing \u2026 Mr. Brennan indicated that the C.I.A., focused on foreign intelligence, was limited in its legal ability to investigate possible connections to Mr. Trump. The officials said Mr. Brennan told [Harry Reid] that the F.B.I., in charge of domestic intelligence, would have to lead the way. Days later, Mr. Reid wrote [James Comey]. In his letter, the senator \u2026 said it was crucial for the F.B.I. to \u2018use every resource available\u2019 to conduct an investigation. \u2026 Some intelligence officials were wary of pushing too aggressively before the election with questions about possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign because of concerns it might be seen as an improper political attempt to help Mrs. Clinton.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cKushner Omitted Meeting With Russians on Security Clearance Forms,\u201d by the New York Times: \u201cWhen Jared Kushner \u2026 sought the top-secret security clearance that would give him access to some of the nation\u2019s most closely guarded secrets, he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign government officials over the last seven years. But Mr. Kushner did not mention dozens of contacts with foreign leaders or officials in recent months. They include a December meeting with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, and one with the head of a Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank, arranged at Mr. Kislyak\u2019s behest. The omissions, which Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyer called an error, are particularly sensitive given the congressional and F.B.I. investigations into contacts between Russian officials and Trump associates.\u201d\n\nRep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas) prepares to question FBI Director James Comey during last month's House Intelligence hearing. He'll now oversee it. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\n-- With Devin Nunes temporarily stepping as House Intelligence chairman so an ethics investigation can run its course, the Russia investigation will now fall to Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Tex). The 68-year-old also serves as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. From Karoun Demirjian: \u201cIn a brief interview, Conaway pledged to work \u2018with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle\u2019 to complete the Russia probe. But Conaway is also a Trump supporter, and he has on various occasions sought to sow doubt about the intelligence community\u2019s conviction that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections to help Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u2026 In the past, Conaway has also said that if Congress wants to probe foreign interference in the 2016 election, it should also look into how \u2018Harry Reid and the Democrats brought in Mexican soap opera stars, singers and entertainers who had immense influence\u2019 to help get out the vote in Las Vegas.\u201d (The Dallas Morning News published a Conaway profile this morning.)\n\nAlso getting more authority with Nunes sidelined is Trey Gowdy, another Intelligence Committee member who has drawn accusations from Democrats of letting partisanship seep into investigations. That was particularly the case when the South Carolina congressman chaired the Benghazi select committee. \u201cGowdy also sits on the House Ethics Committee, which is now investigating Nunes over allegations he may have disclosed classified information against House rules,\u201d Karoun notes.\n\nTHE CHINA SUMMIT CONTINUES:\n\n-- Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago estate, kicking off a two-day summit that Rex Tillerson said would include \u201cvery frank discussions\u201d over North Korea and trade. From David Nakamura: \u201cSpeaking to reporters after greeting Xi at the airport, Tillerson said the U.S. side would press the Chinese delegation to \u2018find ways to exercise influence on North Korea\u2019s actions to dismantle their nuclear weapons and their missile technology program.\u2019 \u2018China can be part of a new strategy to end North Korea\u2019s reckless behavior and ensure security, stability and economic prosperity in Northeast Asia,\u2019 Tillerson added. Trump, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, greeted Xi with a handshake as the Chinese leader and his wife, Peng Liyuan, arrived at the resort for a series of bilateral talks, and a fancy opening night dinner with Trump and his top aides. Trump arrived aboard Air Force One shortly after Xi. While flying, Trump told reporters on the plane that he believes \u201cChina will be stepping up\u201d to deal more firmly with Pyongyang.\u201d\n\n-- Wall Street Journal, \u201cTrump Lacks Staff for Trade Talks With China,\u201d by William Mauldin: \u201cVacancies in key government positions will make it harder for Trump to delve very deeply in trade issues with his Chinese counterpart as the two meet \u2026 The biggest hole in Mr. Trump\u2019s trade team is his pick for U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. The Senate Finance Committee has signaled it will move on his nomination after the Easter recess. \u2026 Also, no one has been nominated for three deputy trade representative positions and two other senior roles, for agriculture and intellectual property, are still unfilled. Another nominee awaiting confirmation is Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for Agriculture Secretary, Sonny Perdue. China has lifted an outright ban on American beef, but lawmakers say there are still barriers keeping American beef out of the country. \u2026 Mr. Trump signaled early on that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will play a key role in trade, but the White House hasn\u2019t named key Commerce undersecretaries to handle international trade and industry security\u2014officials who would more directly oversee trade cases against China and the export of sensitive technology.\u201d\n\nDJ Gribbin, Special Assistant to the President for Infrastructure Polic, holds up a chart showing the regulatory steps to build a highway as Donald Trump speaks during a CEO town hall on Tuesday. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nTHE KING OF DEBT:\n\n-- Trump, who has driven several companies into bankruptcy by over-leveraging himself, is bringing the same mentality to the federal government. He is now considering borrowing \u201cmuch more\u201d than $300 billion to finance his infrastructure plan -- a move that would come as a major break from his campaign pledge to attract large amounts of private money to finance the upgrades to roads, bridges, ports and other things. Damian Paletta and Max Ehrenfreund report: \u201cTrump\u2019s new belief is that the U.S. can borrow money so cheaply now because of low interest rates that it makes sense to issue more debt to borrow the money. \u2026 He also said that an infrastructure arrangement that includes public money with private money \u2018can be very expensive.\u2019 \u2018We are borrowing very inexpensively,\u2019 Trump [said]. \u2018When you can borrow so inexpensively, you don\u2019t have to do the public/private thing.\u2019 When asked if the total U.S. commitment could be $200 billion or $300 billion, he answered quickly, \u2018No. More than that. Much more than that.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- \u201cTrump asked African Americans what they had to lose. For this rural Kentucky community, the answer is tangible,\u201d by Jose A. DelReal: \u201cJust 3 percent of the town\u2019s population is African American, and many of them live along the hilly streets of this particularly frayed neighborhood, where the houses collapsing on their wood frames betray the rural county\u2019s deep poverty. On the campaign trail, Trump had asked African Americans what they had to lose if they voted for him. Here, that question has tangible answers. Jonikka Garrett \u2026 said she believes many of Trump\u2019s critics have gloated that rural Americans voted for Trump only to now see his administration release a budget that would hurt rural voters particularly hard \u2014 and ignoring the reality that one-fifth of rural Americans are Minorites who probably did not support the president. \u2018They\u2019re saying, \u2018Those people are getting what they deserve.\u2019 And I don\u2019t think they\u2019re taking into account that a lot of people here didn\u2019t vote for him, and we\u2019re suffering, too,\u2019 said Garrett, 37. \u2018Personally, I think it\u2019s about being okay with taking another person\u2019s assistance without realizing they\u2019re going to take away yours as well.\u2019\u201d\n\nOBAMACARE PROBLEMS:\n\n-- House Republican leaders moved to modify their stalled health-care bill Thursday after Mike Pence pressured them to show progress before the two week Easter recess. The White House told Paul Ryan that Trump needs to score a \u201cshort-term win\u201d to keep momentum on the legislation and stop repeal efforts from fizzling. Paige Winfield Cunningham, Juliet Eilperin and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cA House aide said Pence and other White House officials painted a \u2018dire\u2019 political picture of what would happen if Republicans fail to act on health care. Ryan also met briefly with Trump ... On Thursday morning, [Ryan] invited more than 20 fellow Republicans to his weekly news conference to unveil an amendment in what appeared to be an effort to show progress toward an accord. \u2018This brings us closer to the final agreement that we all want to achieve,\u2019 Ryan said, later adding that it was \u2018a step in the right direction.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe amendment that the Rules Committee approved Thursday afternoon on a party-line vote would set up a federal insurance pool for those with serious and expensive medical conditions. The idea is to subsidize coverage for patients with preexisting conditions in order to lower premiums for healthier patients. Sean Spicer yesterday described the renewed health-care talks as \u201cconstructive\u201d: \u201cThe amendment that Speaker Ryan talked about putting forward in the rules committee is something that shows tremendous progress by the team. As soon as we get to 215 (votes), we\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\nHuge roadblocks remain. Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows said Thursday that one path to get the \u201cmajority, if not the entire Freedom Caucus\u201d to vote for the bill is by extending the ability for states to apply for waivers to key ACA insurance mandates. But there is little appetite for doing that elsewhere in the House GOP. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) said rolling back such mandates would be a \u201cnonstarter.\u201d \u201cIt goes counter to the president\u2019s promises,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes counter to the promises of more than 200 members of the House.\u201d\n\n-- Meanwhile, another state is at risk of having only one Obamacare health insurer. \u201cTwo insurers announced this week that they would pull out of Iowa's Affordable Care Act exchanges next year, raising worries that the decisions could be the leading edge of a trend,\u201d Carolyn Y. Johnson reports. \u201cInsurers face approaching deadlines and major uncertainties about the short-term viability of the exchanges, and beyond, because of politicians' inability thus far to move a specific repeal and replace plan forward. Aetna informed federal and state regulators that it would not offer plans in Iowa's exchange because of \u2018financial risk and an uncertain outlook for the marketplace\u2019 on Thursday. That followed the announcement Monday that Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield would also pull out of Iowa's marketplaces next year. The combination of the two exits will leave the vast majority of counties in the states with only one insurer, assuming that there are no other changes.\u201d\n\n-- Maryland became the first state in the nation to agree to reimburse Planned Parenthood clinics for their services if Congress defunds the organization, after Republican Gov.

Mitt Romney, the one-time presidential nominee and leading Trump critic, is exploring a run for Hatch\u2019s Senate seat,\u201d McKay Coppins reports in The Atlantic. \u201cAccording to six sources familiar with the situation, Romney has spent recent weeks actively discussing a potential 2018 Senate bid with a range of high-level Republicans in both Utah and Washington, and has privately signaled a growing interest in the idea. Romney, though, has made clear he would not pursue the seat without Hatch\u2019s blessing.\u201d\n\nRomney has spoken with Mitch McConnell: \u201cAccording to two people with knowledge of the conversation, McConnell encouraged Romney to run if Hatch\u2019s seat opens up, and sought to assure the former GOP presidential nominee that he would have more influence in the chamber than a typical junior senator.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to two people with knowledge of the conversation, McConnell encouraged Romney to run if Hatch\u2019s seat opens up, and sought to assure the former GOP presidential nominee that he would have more influence in the chamber than a typical junior senator.\u201d The story quotes \u201ctwo people close to Romney\u201d saying he didn\u2019t show a real interest in the Senate race until his longtime rival/frenemy Jon Huntsman began to consider a bid. Now Huntsman has been sidelined by being appointed ambassador to Russia.\n\nNow Huntsman has been sidelined by being appointed ambassador to Russia. Romney would skate to victory if he ran. Everyone agrees.\n\n-- \u201cThe idea of Senator Mitt Romney should scare Trump,\u201d Aaron Blake writes on The Fix. \u201cRomney would come in to the Senate with almost unimpeachable power to say whatever he wanted about Trump, should he choose to do so. And in our highly partisan era, it would be a completely unusual and potentially must-see political dynamic.\u201d\n\nBill O'Reilly poses on the set of his show in 2015. (Brendan McDermid/File)\n\nO\u2019REILLY HUNKERS DOWN:\n\n-- \u201cFox News and its star host Bill O\u2019Reilly appear to have developed a strategy in response to allegations of serial sexual harassment and the mass defections of advertisers from O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program: Say as little as possible,\u201d Paul Farhi reports. \u201cThe voluble TV personality has said nothing on the air about the controversy since it broke over the weekend. Fox News has all but ignored any reporting about it in its broadcasts and on its website; its one acknowledgment was a 25-second summary on its \u2018Media Buzz\u2019 program on Sunday. It has not mentioned the advertiser reaction. Fox\u2019s parent company, meanwhile, has confined its comments to a brief statement issued Saturday saying, in part, that it \u2018takes matters of workplace behavior very seriously.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- O\u2019Reilly\u2019s audience is sticking with him so far: \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d attracted 3.8 million viewers Tuesday night, according to Nielsen, a 20 percent increase over the program\u2019s ratings a week before and 19 percent more than on the same date last year, per Farhi.\n\n-- A portion of his new book, \u201cOld School,\u201d is likely to raise more than a few eyebrows. A section entitled \u201cNo means no\u201d is dedicated to sexual consent. \"It would be easy to make fun of all the hoops college administrators expect their students to jump through today before they engage in any kind of intimacy,\" he writes. \"But there's no middle ground here. It's all about the Old School tenets of respect and responsibility. No means no.\" (CNN)\n\nAfter Trump fired him, Preet Bharara thanked well-wishers outside his office last month. (Larry Neumeister/AP)\n\nPREET GOES PUBLIC:\n\n-- In his first public appearance since being fired, former U.S. attorney of Manhattan Preet Bharara offered a brutal and sometimes humorous critique of Trump's administration, saying that draining \"the swamp\" requires more than a \"slogan.\" Renae Merle reports from New York: \"There is a swamp, a lot of the system is rigged and lots of your fellow Americans have been forgotten and have been left behind. Those are not alternative facts. That is not fake news,\" Bharara said during an hour-long speech at the Cooper Union last night. \"But I would respectfully submit you don't drain a swamp with a slogan. You don't drain it by replacing one set of partisans with another. You don't replace muck with muck. To drain a swamp you need an Army Corps of Engineers, experts schooled in service and serious purpose, not do-nothing, say-anything neophyte opportunists who know a lot about how to bully and bluster but not so much about truth, justice and fairness.\"\n\nBharara had been asked to stay on by Trump after the election but was then fired: \"I was asked to resign. I refused. I insisted on being fired and so I was,\" Bharara said last night. \"I don\u2019t understand why that was such a big deal. Especially to this White House. I had thought that was what Donald Trump was good at.\u201d Asked why he was fired, Bharara said: \"Beats the hell out of me.\"\n\nVladimir Putin divorced his wife Lyudmila Putina in 2014. They had been married for 30 years. (Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images)\n\nTHREE GOOD READS ON HOW MOSCOW OPERATES:\n\n-- \u201cPutin\u2019s ex-wife returns to the spotlight with a dashing young husband and a fancy French villa,\u201d by Adam Taylor: \u201cLyudmila Putin was the wife of Vladimir Putin for three decades. They [married in 1983] and moved to East Germany \u2026 where her husband was a KGB spy. But as Vladimir [began his reign] in Moscow, Lyudmila was seen less and less in public. Wild rumors in the Russian press suggested that he had packed her off to a monastery. Since then, Russians have heard little about Lyudmila \u2026 But many ordinary citizens remained fascinated by her, eager to know what happened to the woman who may have gotten closer to Putin than anyone else. Now, almost four years later, details about Lyudmila\u2019s new life are emerging. And rather than turning up at a remote monastery, she appears to be planning a lavish life at a European villa, with a new husband 20 years her junior. These new details offer not only a glimpse into the notoriously private world of Putin\u2019s family, barely acknowledged in official accounts and the subject of tabloid gossip, but also a hint of the wealth that critics say the Russian president and those in his inner circle have acquired over recent years.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cRussian media wrongly accused a Muslim man of the St. Petersburg bombing. It nearly ruined his life,\u201d by Andrew Roth: \u201cFor several hours, the face of the St. Petersburg suicide bomber was pretty much the one many Russians expected it to be: a young man with a long, thick beard, wearing a black overcoat and the traditional prayer cap of a pious Muslim. TV news stations and Russian online sites [rushed to] broadcast grainy security footage of the man \u2026 Except he wasn\u2019t the terrorist. It was Ilyas Nikitin \u2026 a former army captain who fought Islamic separatists as a Russian officer in Chechnya and later converted to Islam. \u2018This case has deeply complicated my life,\u2019 Nikitin [said]. \u2026 Since the bombing, he said, he had been pulled off a flight because other passengers recognized him as the suspected bomber and was told he could lose his job because of the investigation. The story is a cautionary tale of the speed with which digital sleuthing, instant Twitter news updates, and racial profiling can yield devastating consequences for their targets. For journalists, the Internet has proven to be a quick source of vetted information and expert collaboration \u2014 but it also has the potential to destroy lives.\u201d\n\n-- Buzzfeed, \u201cA Network Of Russian-Language News Sites Is Secretly Owned By The Kremlin, Investigation Finds,\u201d by Miriam Elder: \u201cA network of Russian language news sites based in the Baltics is secretly owned by the Kremlin-owned holding that runs Russia Today and Sputnik, an investigation by Re:Baltica, a Latvian outlet, has found. The investigation showed that Baltnews, a network of sites targeting the Russian speaking minority in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, was actually owned by Rossiya Segodnya, the holding company created in November 2014 to run a host of Kremlin-owned news outlets. The investigation \u2026 said Rossiya Segodnya\u2019s ownership was \u2018obscured by a chain of owners, seemingly designed to make it appear as though Baltnews arose from local organizations.\u2019 [The investigation] found that the outlets\u2019 websites are registered to a [Dutch] company called Media Capital Holding B.V. \u2026 [which in turn] is owned by a Russian-registered company \u2026 which in turn is owned by the Russian newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti. That newspaper is itself owned by \u2026 a state-owned newswire that falls under the umbrella of Rossiya Segodnya.\u201d The Baltic states remain on high alert for Russian meddling, as the Kremlin develops and ever-more confrontational foreign policy.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThe menu from dinner at mar a lago pic.twitter.com/5VsCi2Ly99 \u2014 Bill Bishop (@niubi) April 7, 2017\n\nMeanwhile, people continued to mock Jared Kushner's trip to Iraq:\n\nDonald Trump Jr. weighed in on the nuclear option:\n\nJust curious: Didn't Dems change this rule in 2013?

(Justin Wm.

From Laura Vozzella: \u201cGillespie made those promises at a news conference on Richmond\u2019s Capitol Square, where the GOP-controlled legislature has repeatedly killed bills intended to prevent candidates from using political cash for personal expenses. Since a gifts scandal engulfed former governor Robert F. McDonnell (R) in 2013, Virginia\u2019s legislature has moved to tighten the state\u2019s notoriously lax ethics and campaign-finance rules year after year. But loopholes remain. And the Republicans who control both chambers in Richmond have been flatly opposed to bans on personal use, arguing that restrictions would trip up even honest public servants. Gillespie\u2019s proposals were part of a broader ethics and government-transparency plan he unveiled in the company of the outgoing and incoming speakers of Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates \u2014 a powerful signal that Gillespie\u2019s personal-use ban would fare better than the one Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) endorsed to no avail this year.\u201d\n\n-- D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser\u2019s administration has cleared a major stumbling block in her effort to close the city\u2019s dilapidated shelter for homeless families at the former D.C. General Hospital. Aaron C. Davis reports: \u201cAttorneys for the city prevailed this week in zoning fights with neighbors of two of the proposed sites, winning approval to move forward with construction as early as November, although opponents could still file appeals. The development gives the District a realistic chance to close D.C. General by 2020 \u2014 six years after the disappearance of an 8-year-old girl put a spotlight on city\u2019s emerging epidemic of family homelessness and overcrowded conditions at the District\u2019s main shelter.\u201d\n\n-- D.C. police officials revoked the police powers of an officer yesterday after he was arrested in Anne Arundel County on multiple offenses, including armed robbery, assault and prostitution.

Superior Court, causing an estimated $50,000 in damage. Keith Alexander reports: \u201cProsecutors charged Tyree Nolan, 20, of no fixed address, with felony destruction of government property and domestic violence threats. Authorities say Nolan got into an altercation with another woman inside the courthouse on Wednesday during a domestic hearing involving a man who had dated both women at some point. During the hearing, court documents say, Nolan repeatedly threatened to kill the other woman, causing the boyfriend and court security officers to intervene. Neither woman knew of the other before the hearing, according to the documents. Nolan and the boyfriend have a child together. Nolan was escorted out of the courthouse by security. While outside, she picked up a rock and threw it at the glass window of the courthouse.\u201d\n\n-- A Southwest Washington man was charged with five counts of second-degree sexual abuse and three counts of assault in connection with the alleged assault of seven teenage girls in the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History. Keith reports: \u201cAuthorities say Devone L. Foote, 35, walked up to a group of 13- and 14-year-old girls from California and touched their buttocks as the teens toured the museum\u2019s butterfly exhibit. Prosecutors say Foote also pressed his groin against one of the teen\u2019s buttocks. The girl\u2019s chaperon reported the incident to a museum security office. Foote has been ordered to remain in D.C. jail until his next hearing.\u201d\n\nVIDEOS OF THE DAY:\n\nWho's the \"idiot?\"\n\nAnd this:\n\nOne more from Colbert:\n\nCalling all Homeland fans:\n\nConan breaks it down with Wanda Sykes:\n\nHow will the Senate change after Republicans went nuclear?
