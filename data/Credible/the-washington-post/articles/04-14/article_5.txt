He had never heard of the congressional procedures (known as reconciliation) that forced him to push for health care changes before overhauling the tax code\u2026</p> <p><strong>\u201cBut as seasoned hands got access to him, he retreated from some of his provocative promises,\u201d </strong>Peter notes. \u201cHe delayed his vow to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem after King Abdullah II of Jordan rushed to Washington to warn him of a violent backlash among Arabs. He abandoned his intention to bring back torture in terrorism interrogations after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told him it was ineffective.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Another wrinkle: It\u2019s not just Trump who is learning all of this as he goes. </strong>\u201cHis White House chief of staff, chief strategist, senior adviser, counselor and national economics adviser have no prior government experience of consequence,\u201d the Times story concludes. \u201cNor do his secretaries of state, Treasury, commerce, housing or education.\u201d</p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-center horizontal-photo\"> <img class=\"zoom-in\" src=\"https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/4243192a8c5e4cfd316f403be298dbd8-908-703-zzrankin.jpg\"> <div class=\"pb-caption\"> Jeanette Rankin, the nation\u2019s first woman congressman, voted against America\u2019s entry into both World War I and II.

He was a one-man show and handled a little bit of everything, from personal injury cases to a Ukrainian investment fund to a fleet of taxis to a trust account he managed for clients. One day in 1999, a check for $350,000 was deposited into that trust account, to be disbursed to a woman living in South Florida. As the lawyer in charge of the account, Cohen was supposed to ensure that she got the money. But he didn\u2019t. Why not? And what ultimately happened to all that money? \u2018I don\u2019t recall,\u2019 Cohen said in a deposition. The missing $350,000 \u2014 which has never been recovered \u2014 became the centerpiece of a 2009 lawsuit in Miami, where Cohen was accused of civil fraud. After years of litigation, Cohen prevailed, in part because the suit was filed past the statute of limitations. But <strong>Cohen\u2019s own testimony in the case reveals that the man who is now the president\u2019s personal lawyer failed to execute one of the core duties of an attorney \u2014 properly handling money placed in his trust \u2014 and was cavalier about that failure.</strong>\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- Trump quietly tapped former Washington state senator Don Benton to run the Selective Service System that oversees the U.S. military draft, even though he\u2019s never served a day in uniform.&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/don-benton-draft-board_us_58ef89d7e4b0b9e98489e9a0\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Huffington Post\u2019s Christina&nbsp;Wilkie&nbsp;reports</a>: \u201cBenton had originally been expected to fill a top position at the [EPA] where he was part of the Trump \u2018landing team\u2019 during the presidential transition. But this was before Benton began to infuriate his boss, the newly confirmed Administrator Scott Pruitt. Benton\u2019s habit of interrupting policy discussions to make bizarre comments became so maddening \u2026 that senior staff began keeping him out of policy meetings. All of which posed a dilemma for the president: On one hand, Benton was an early Trump supporter and the chair of Trump\u2019s Washington state campaign. Given how few Republican legislators were early Trump supporters, there was a real desire to reward each one. On the other hand, the agency where Benton was actually qualified to work, the EPA, did not want to hire him. So Trump\u2019s solution was to give Benton oversight of the military draft.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- British spy agencies were the first to spot Trump team\u2019s links with Russia last year, and played a \u201ccrucial\u201d role in alerting their counterparts in Washington, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/13/british-spies-first-to-spot-trump-team-links-russia?CMP=share_btn_tw\"><strong>The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding, Stephanie Kirchgaessner and Nick Hopkins</strong></a><strong> report:</strong> \u201cGCHQ first became aware in late 2015 of suspicious 'interactions' between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents \u2026 This intelligence was passed to the US as part of a routine exchange of information, they added.

But descriptions of the inner workings of her party by present and former close Le Pen associates, as well as court documents, raise fresh doubts about the success and sincerity of those efforts. Even before Ms. Le Pen\u2019s remarks this week denying France\u2019s culpability in a notorious wartime roundup of Jews, recent revelations in the French news media \u2026 revived nagging concerns about the sympathies of the woman who would be France\u2019s next president. Two men in her innermost circle \u2014 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon and Axel Loustau \u2014 are well-known former members of a violent, far-right student union that fought pitched battles with leftists and took a turn toward Hitler nostalgia in the mid-1990s. They are longtime associates of Ms. Le Pen since her days in law school in the 1980s and remain among her closest friends.\u201d</p> <p><strong>-- From </strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21720589-win-frances-national-front-unlikely-potentially-disastrous-eu-should-plan?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/charlemagnetheeushouldplanforamarinelepenpresidency\"><strong>The Economist</strong></a><strong>:</strong> <strong>\u201c[Le Pen] is unlikely to become president; France\u2019s two-round system inoculates against extremist parties like her National Front.

Starting next month, the full court will take up the president\u2019s entry ban for immigrants from some countries, followed by the case of a transgender teen whose battle to use a boy\u2019s bathroom challenges the president\u2019s new policy. Since taking office, [Trump] has harshly criticized federal judges&nbsp; \u2026 as in \u2018chaos\u2019 and \u2018turmoil.\u2019 Yet the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, a Richmond-based venue the administration might once have found reliably hospitable, now has a higher proportion of judges tapped by Democrats than most of the nation\u2019s 13 circuit courts. A test of how far the 4th Circuit bench has tilted left will come May 8.

In a little noticed but important speech to Christian pastors last week, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) \u2013 who earned a Ph.D. in history from Yale \u2013 decried the alt-right movement as inconsistent with America\u2019s founding ideals. </strong>Yahoo\u2019s Jon Ward, the only journalist <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/clashing-views-america-sen-sasse-challenges-alt-right-163008280.html?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\">who covered the speech</a>, notes that the Breitbart crowd believes America\u2019s greatness originated or resides in European or white Christian culture. Sasse made the case to a group called the Gospel Coalition that America\u2019s identity is bound up in an idea, not a piece of land or any racial group. \u201cAmerican exceptionalism was never a claim about ethnicity. American exceptionalism was never a claim about Americans\u2019 unique anthropology,\u201d Sasse said in Indianapolis. \u201cAmerican exceptionalism was an understanding about the historical moment in which the American founding flipped on its head the relationship between rights and government. \u2026 That\u2019s all American exceptionalism means.\u201d</p> <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\"

(Carlos Barria/Reuters)\n\nWith Breanne Deppisch\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Donald Trump believed he could convince China to pressure North Korea to stop its nuclear activities. Then President Xi Jinping tutored him on the history of the region.\n\n\u201cAfter listening for 10 minutes, I realized that it\u2019s not so easy,\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, recounting the session at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cYou know, I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power over North Korea. But it\u2019s not what you would think.\"\n\nThis comment is funny because, in 2011, Trump claimed that he has read \u201chundreds of books about China over the decades,\u201d including works by Henry Kissinger, American journalists and Chinese novelists. Looking to do more business with Beijing, he provided a list of 20 books about China to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, that he said had helped him understand the country, its politics and its people. \u201cI know the Chinese. I've made a lot of money with the Chinese. I understand the Chinese mind,\u201d Trump said six years ago. His list had some surprising titles on it, including \u201cBattle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.\u201d\n\nColor me skeptical that Trump has read anything by Amy Chua.\n\n-- Even if he has, the fact our president needed an introductory tutorial on Sino-Korean relations to understand how hard it is to contain Pyongyang is just the latest illustration of one of his blind spots: He and his inner-circle have very little sense of history.\n\n-- It is a clich\u00e9, but there is truth to it: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\n\nDonald Trump makes a dramatic entrance from inside the Lincoln Memorial during a \"Make America Great Again\" concert the night before his inauguration. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n-- Trump has committed several small but memorable faux pas since the inauguration:\n\nHe mentioned Abraham Lincoln during a fundraising dinner for the National Republican Congressional Committee last month. \u201cMost people don't even know he was a Republican,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDoes anyone know? Lot of people don't know that!\u201d (Most likely, every person in the ballroom knew and has attended at least one Lincoln Day dinner.)\n\nOn Lincoln\u2019s birthday in February, Trump tweeted out an obviously fake quote from the 16th president: \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s not the years in your life that count, it's the life in your years.\u201d He later deleted it.\n\n\u201cFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice,\u201d he said at a Black History Month event. (Douglass died in 1895.)\n\n\u201cHave you heard of Susan B. Anthony?\u201d he asked at a Women\u2019s History Month reception in March.\n\nIn January, Trump said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) \u2013 who is best known for almost getting beaten to death as he marched on Bloody Sunday in Selma \u2013 is \u201call talk, talk, talk - no action or results.\u201d There are things Lewis could be fairly criticized for, but no one who knows anything about the civil rights movement would agree that being \u201call talk\u201d is one of them.\n\nDonald Trump salutes after laying a wreath at the tomb of Andrew Jackson after touring The Hermitage in Nashville on March 15. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- Those four gaffes were tailormade to go viral on social media, but the president has made other comments that perhaps better underscore his lack of depth on U.S. history. Only someone who doesn\u2019t understand the ugly history of the 1930s, for example, could have so wholeheartedly embraced \u201cAmerica First\u201d as a mantra, let alone made it a rallying cry in his inaugural address. The slogan was first popularized by Nazi sympathizers.\n\n-- Trump has embraced Andrew Jackson as his political idol, hanging his portrait in the Oval Office and even flying to Nashville on his 250th birthday to lay a wreath on his tomb. In a speech there, he identified with the seventh president because he took on the \u201carrogant elite.\u201d \u201cDoes that sound familiar?\u201d Trump said with a sly smile.\n\nYet the very next week, in Louisville, the president claimed the mantle of Henry Clay. \"Henry Clay believed in what he called the 'American system,' and proposed tariffs to protect American industry and finance American infrastructure,\" the president said in a long riff. \"Like Henry Clay, we want to put our own people to work. \u2026 Clay was a fierce advocate for American manufacturing. ... He knew all the way back, (in the) early 1800s, Clay said that trade must be fair, equal, and reciprocal. Boom!\"\n\nAnyone who has a passing familiarity with 19th century history knows how goofy it is to embrace both Jackson and Clay. \u201cThey were absolutely feral enemies,\" Fergus Bordewich, a Clay biographer, told Time after Trump\u2019s speech. \"They absolutely hated each other. They shared almost no views in common.\u201d\n\nSean Spicer listens to a reporter's question during his daily briefing yesterday. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\n-- Sean Spicer\u2019s cringe-worthy comments this week that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s actions were worse than Adolf Hitler\u2019s suggested a more endemic problem of historical illiteracy in the White House. The press secretary has since apologized for saying that Hitler \u201cwas not using the gas on his own people in the same way that Assad is doing.\u201d He also referred to concentration camps as \u201cthe Holocaust centers.\u201d\n\nBecause Spicer made his comment on the first day of Passover, the observant staff members at the Anti-Defamation League had their phones and televisions off. So they didn\u2019t find out until Wednesday night what had happened. Leaders of the group reached out to the White House yesterday to offer a training session on the Holocaust. \u201cThe organization has taught classes on Hitler\u2019s murderous campaign \u2014 which exterminated 6 million Jews and millions more LGBT people, Poles, socialists and others \u2014 to more than 130,000 law enforcement professionals and 35,000 teachers,\u201d Julie Zauzmer reports. ADL is willing to offer a free session to Spicer or \u201canyone at the White House who may need to learn more about the Holocaust.\u201d Spicer didn\u2019t respond to an email about whether he\u2019d do it.\n\n-- Trump has admitted that he is not intellectually curious. In a moment of candor, he told The Post\u2019s Marc Fisher last summer that he has not read any biographies of presidents. He said he would like to someday but never has time. Then he explained that he does not need to read extensively because he reaches the right decisions \u201cwith very little knowledge other than the knowledge I [already] had, plus the words \u2018common sense,\u2019 because I have a lot of common sense.\u201d Trump told Marc he is skeptical of experts because they can\u2019t see the forest through the trees and lack his good instincts.\n\n-- This is a break with many of his predecessors. Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all invited elite historians for private dinners at the White House. Each thought deeply about his place in history as he mulled weighty decisions. Bush, who majored in history at Yale, heavily employed historical analogies in his speeches. John F. Kennedy even hired Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to be his in-house historian.\n\nThen-President Obama waits to speak at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in Johannesburg. (White House Photo by Pete Souza)\n\n-- Trump\u2019s very dark world view is one of the ways his lack of historical perspective manifests itself. David Nakamura contrasts how Obama and Trump see the world in a piece for today\u2019s paper:\n\n\u201cAddressing the United Nations last fall, Obama took a moment to highlight for fellow world leaders what he called \u2018the most important fact\u2019 about the state of global affairs: Human existence on planet Earth is good \u2014 and getting better. War is down, he said, while life expectancy is up. Democracy is on the march, and science has beaten back infectious diseases. A girl in a remote village can download the \u2018entirety of human knowledge\u2019 on a smartphone. A person born today, Obama concluded, is more likely to be safer, healthier, wealthier and better-educated \u2014 and to see a path to prosperity \u2014 than at \u2018any time in human history.\u2019\"\n\nPresident Trump does not inhabit this world: \"To Trump, the world is \u2018a mess,\u2019 as he said during a White House news conference this week. \u2018It\u2019s crazy what\u2019s going on,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018Whether it\u2019s the Middle East or you look at \u2014 no matter where \u2014 Ukraine \u2014 whatever you look at, it\u2019s got problems, so many problems. Right now, it\u2019s nasty.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama constantly reminded us that our own times are not uniquely oppressive,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and author at Rice University. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling due to the 24-7 news cycle that everything is a crisis mode, when the fact of the matter is, Americans have it better now than ever before.\u201d\n\nDuring a town hall-style event with young people in Malaysia in September, Obama blamed the flow of information bombarding news consumers on televisions, computers and smartphones for making it appear \u201cas if the world is falling apart.\u201d \u201cEverybody is shouting and everybody hates each other,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd you get kind of depressed. You think, \u2018Goodness, what\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump, of course, consumes most of his news from cable television and Twitter.\n\n-- Bigger picture: One important reason the new president has flip-flopped so much in recent days is because he has never grappled deeply or seriously with most issues. Trump has typically staked out whatever position was most politically expedient at that moment and then confidently argued for it, untethered by core convictions beyond a desire to make money, build his brand and win elections.\n\n\u201cHe's learning the job,\u201d Mitch McConnell told Newsmax TV in an interview that aired yesterday.\n\n\u201cSome of the things that were said during the campaign, I think he now knows simply aren't the way things ought to be,\u201d said the Senate Majority Leader, who wrote his senior thesis on Henry Clay and hangs a portrait of him in his office. \u201cI welcome adjustments that he makes from the campaign. A lot of things are said in the campaign by candidates and turn out not to be the way it works when you're actually in office.\"\n\n-- Governing is hard, and Trump\u2019s own associates acknowledge that he didn\u2019t begin to fully grasp that until January. Every president faces a Herculean learning curve. Nothing can fully prepare anyone for the job. Trump, as our first president with no prior political or military experience, had more to learn than anyone before him. Not only does he lack a lot of historical knowledge, he is also missing institutional memory.\n\n\u201cNobody knew that health care could be so complicated,\u201d he said in February to a group of governors who all understood exactly how complicated the subject is. \u201cIt's an unbelievably complex subject!\u201d\n\nThat is the most memorable example in a growing list of things that he\u2019s now publicly admitted are harder than he realized, including getting one\u2019s nominees confirmed by the Senate and doing tax reform.\n\nWhen Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin on the phone in February, the Russian leader raised the possibility of extending the 2010 New START treaty. Trump paused to ask his aides what the treaty was, Reuters reported at the time.\n\n-- On the front page of today\u2019s New York Times, Peter Baker recalls other good examples of just how much Trump was in over his head when he took office: \u201cSo much of this is new to Mr. Trump that only after he publicly accused Mr. Obama of having wiretapped his telephones last year did he ask aides how the system of obtaining eavesdropping warrants from a special foreign intelligence court worked. \u2026 He figured it would be easy to ban visitors from several predominantly Muslim countries and build a border wall while forcing Mexico to pay for it. He had never heard of the congressional procedures (known as reconciliation) that forced him to push for health care changes before overhauling the tax code\u2026\n\n\u201cBut as seasoned hands got access to him, he retreated from some of his provocative promises,\u201d Peter notes. \u201cHe delayed his vow to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem after King Abdullah II of Jordan rushed to Washington to warn him of a violent backlash among Arabs. He abandoned his intention to bring back torture in terrorism interrogations after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told him it was ineffective.\u201d\n\nAnother wrinkle: It\u2019s not just Trump who is learning all of this as he goes. \u201cHis White House chief of staff, chief strategist, senior adviser, counselor and national economics adviser have no prior government experience of consequence,\u201d the Times story concludes. \u201cNor do his secretaries of state, Treasury, commerce, housing or education.\u201d\n\nJeanette Rankin, the nation\u2019s first woman congressman, voted against America\u2019s entry into both World War I and II.

(Steve Helber/AP)\n\n-- \u201cTwo Republicans running for Virginia governor repeatedly accused each other of lying Thursday while the third called their tax-cut plans disingenuous and even dangerous in the only scheduled TV debate of the race,\u201d Laura Vozzella reports from Lynchburg: \u201cCorey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, was the most aggressive during the hourlong event at Liberty University, taking aim at political strategist Ed Gillespie, the perceived front-runner because he has led in fundraising and endorsements. Stewart accused Gillespie of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants and of endorsing, in his 2006 memoir, the \u2018individual mandate\u2019 for health insurance \u2014 akin to a requirement under the Affordable Care Act. Gillespie said neither was true. \u2018Google \u2018Corey Stewart lies\u2019 and you\u2019ll be amazed at all that pops up,\u2019 Gillespie said. Stewart dug in. \u2018Page 245 of your book, Ed,\u2019 he said, referring to the passage in Gillespie\u2019s \u2018Winning Right\u2019 that he said endorsed the insurance mandate. \u2018If you really want to find the truth, go to Establishment Ed,\u2019 he added, referring to a website that mocks the former [RNC] chairman.\u201d\n\nMilitary officers visit the birthplace of North Korean founder Kim Il Sung this morning, a day before the 105th anniversary of his birth, in Mangyongdae, just outside Pyongyang.

Expectations for a nuclear test or missile launch in the lead-up to Saturday\u2019s celebrations in Pyongyang have not come to pass.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nTHE AGENDA:\n\n-- Behind closed doors, the president signed legislation allowing states to withhold federal family planning dollars from clinics that provide abortion services \u2013 a move that could deprive Planned Parenthood and several other groups of tens of millions in funding. Juliet Eilperin reports: \u201cThe move marked the 12th time that Trump has signed a resolution under the 1996 Congressional Review Act to abolish a rule issued under [Obama]. While congressional Republicans have overturned several Obama-era rules with ease under the CRA \u2014 which allows lawmakers to nullify regulations within 60 legislative days of enactment as long as the president agrees \u2014 the elimination of the Health and Human Services regulation was more controversial.\u201d Abortion-rights advocates have warned that the funding measure would deny as many as four million Americans access to family planning services. Though almost all of these signing ceremonies have taken place before cameras, this one was closed to the press and the president made no statement. (I wrote last month about other things the president has signed and not wanted the public to see.)\n\n-- The Trump administration halted an Obama-era regulation aimed at limiting the dumping of toxic metals from the power plants into public waterways. Brady Dennis reports: \u201cBeginning in 2018, power plants would have had to begin showing that they were using the most up-to-date technology to remove heavy metals \u2014 including lead, arsenic, mercury and other pollutants \u2014 from their wastewater. Scott Pruitt wrote that the EPA plans to postpone compliance deadlines for the regulation \u2026 [which it said] would cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars a year to comply with. The move drew immediate condemnation from environmental groups, which called it a gift to the energy industry. They insisted that the Trump administration focused only on potential costs of the rule while ignoring its benefits, and that delays in compliance will endanger wildlife and pose health threats to families that live near coal plants, as exposure to heavy metals can cause problems with cognitive development in children, among other problems.\u201d\n\n-- Ben Carson toured a Miami apartment complex Thursday that one his hosts said would not exist without the help of a grant that Trump wants eliminated. From the Miami Herald: \u201c\u2018This building wouldn\u2019t have come to fruition without the HOME fund,\u2019 Stephanie Berman, president of Carrfour Supportive Housing, said a few steps from Carson during his tour of one of the charity\u2019s Miami properties ... Trump\u2019s push for a leaner HUD has Miami\u2019s local governments on edge, given the county\u2019s loss of $6 million in homeless grants under the Obama administration and the millions more of housing and development funds that flow from Carson\u2019s agency into municipal budgets. HUD\u2019s $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program \u2014 commonly known as \u2018CDB\u2019 \u2014 also would end under Trump\u2019s budget. That could mean a loss of $4 million a year in Miami alone, according to a city analysis.\u201d\n\n-- U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said the agency has $20 million in funding to support a U.S.-Mexican border wall \u2013 enough to construct just seven miles of the 1,000-mile border wall Trump promised during his campaign. Current estimates to build the wall have soared past $20 billion, with existing fence along the border costing roughly $2.8 million per mile. The remaining cash would need to come from Congress, where lawmakers have indicated they are unlikely to foot the bill anytime soon. Mexico is not going to pay for it either.

But the Trump voter still believes the president will deliver on his promise to protect blue-collar jobs \u2014 even though Trump just backed down from his pledge to label China a currency manipulator on \u2018day one.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not an economist,\u2019 said Staub, 47. \u2018I\u2019m just a guy in Ohio trying to make parts.

That\u2019s what some in GOP establishment say they see,\u201d by Abby Phillip and John Wagner: \u201cIn recent days, the president has done an about-face and embraced many of the policy positions he once scorned as the trappings of a foolhardy establishment. \u2026 Among those heartened by the changes is Elliott Abrams, a former \u2018never Trump\u2019 Republican who later had a change of heart but was rejected for a senior post in Trump\u2019s State Department because he was considered too much of an \u2018establishment Republican.\u2019 \u2018I would say this is looking more now like a more conventional Republican administration,\u2019 said Abrams, who served as a foreign policy adviser in Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush administrations. \u2018To me that\u2019s a very good thing.\u2019 \u2026 One former Trump aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said that the president is known to form initial opinions based on instinct but then to later change his stance based on new information and the influence of his advisers.\u201d\n\nGary Cohn chats up Ivanka Trump.

In a White House short on experienced personnel, Cohn has found an edge by hiring two dozen policy experts, most with government experience \u2026 [who have produced] detailed proposals on overhauling the tax code, rebuilding infrastructure, cutting back financial regulations and restructuring international trade deals. He is widely considered a future candidate to be chief of staff.\"\n\nNow Cohn finds himself in the awkward position of being praised by Democrats but shunned by strong Trump allies. \u201cCohn might be a newbie to policy and Washington, but you have to give him credit for one thing: While others seemed engaged in ideological and \u2018House of Cards\u2019-like staff warfare, he quietly and quickly focused on the first rule of governing,\" said former NEC director Gene Sperling (who worked for Obama and Bill Clinton). \"He hired some competent, professional staff at the NEC, and it has paid off for him.\u201d\n\n-- Stephen Miller, originally aligned with Steve Bannon, hedged his bets by cozying up to Jared Kushner. Politico\u2019s Josh Dawsey and Eliana Johnson report: \u201cAs the relationship between Kushner and Bannon has deteriorated, Miller has made sure his colleagues know he\u2019s not on Bannon\u2019s team. The 31-year-old speechwriter is now working closely with Kushner\u2019s Office of American Innovation, as well as on family leave, child care and women\u2019s issues with Kushner\u2019s wife, Ivanka Trump. \u2026 Miller, who wrote Trump\u2019s fiery \u2018American carnage\u2019 inaugural address, continues to work on the president\u2019s speeches but takes direction from others on their tone. He\u2019s also begun working on energy and regulatory issues, while focusing less on immigration, the issue about which he\u2019s long been most passionate. The shifting and seemingly divergent fortunes of the president\u2019s most ideologically committed advisers, both nationalist firebrands who forged their partnership working together to scuttle the 2013 \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 immigration reform bill, illustrates the changing imperatives for those closest to Trump as he learns how to govern.\u201d\n\nMichael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Rick Perry talk with each other in the lobby at Trump Tower in December. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MEN:\n\n-- \u201cWhy Trump\u2019s Lawyer Was Sued Over $350,000 He Says He Doesn\u2019t Remember Cashing,\u201d by BuzzFeed\u2019s Anthony Cormier: \u201cLong before he became [Trump\u2019s] feared attack dog, or began to visit the White House as the president\u2019s personal attorney, or took a position with the [RNC] \u2026 Michael Cohen ran a small legal practice in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. He was a one-man show and handled a little bit of everything, from personal injury cases to a Ukrainian investment fund to a fleet of taxis to a trust account he managed for clients. One day in 1999, a check for $350,000 was deposited into that trust account, to be disbursed to a woman living in South Florida. As the lawyer in charge of the account, Cohen was supposed to ensure that she got the money. But he didn\u2019t. Why not? And what ultimately happened to all that money? \u2018I don\u2019t recall,\u2019 Cohen said in a deposition. The missing $350,000 \u2014 which has never been recovered \u2014 became the centerpiece of a 2009 lawsuit in Miami, where Cohen was accused of civil fraud. After years of litigation, Cohen prevailed, in part because the suit was filed past the statute of limitations. But Cohen\u2019s own testimony in the case reveals that the man who is now the president\u2019s personal lawyer failed to execute one of the core duties of an attorney \u2014 properly handling money placed in his trust \u2014 and was cavalier about that failure.\u201d\n\n-- Trump quietly tapped former Washington state senator Don Benton to run the Selective Service System that oversees the U.S. military draft, even though he\u2019s never served a day in uniform. The Huffington Post\u2019s Christina Wilkie reports: \u201cBenton had originally been expected to fill a top position at the [EPA] where he was part of the Trump \u2018landing team\u2019 during the presidential transition. But this was before Benton began to infuriate his boss, the newly confirmed Administrator Scott Pruitt. Benton\u2019s habit of interrupting policy discussions to make bizarre comments became so maddening \u2026 that senior staff began keeping him out of policy meetings. All of which posed a dilemma for the president: On one hand, Benton was an early Trump supporter and the chair of Trump\u2019s Washington state campaign. Given how few Republican legislators were early Trump supporters, there was a real desire to reward each one. On the other hand, the agency where Benton was actually qualified to work, the EPA, did not want to hire him. So Trump\u2019s solution was to give Benton oversight of the military draft.\u201d\n\n-- British spy agencies were the first to spot Trump team\u2019s links with Russia last year, and played a \u201ccrucial\u201d role in alerting their counterparts in Washington, The Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding, Stephanie Kirchgaessner and Nick Hopkins report: \u201cGCHQ first became aware in late 2015 of suspicious 'interactions' between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents \u2026 This intelligence was passed to the US as part of a routine exchange of information, they added. Over the next six months, until summer 2016, a number of western agencies shared further information on contacts between Trump's inner circle and Russians, sources said. Australia, a member of the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 spying alliance that also includes the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand, also relayed material, one source said. The alleged conversations were picked up by chance as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets. Over several months, different agencies targeting the same people began to see a pattern of connections that were flagged to intelligence officials in the US.\u201d\n\nTHE MOTHER OF ALL BOMBS:\n\n-- The U.S. military dropped a 22,000-pound bomb on Islamic State forces in eastern Afghanistan Thursday, Pentagon officials confirmed, unleashing America\u2019s most powerful non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat. Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Erin Cunningham report: \u201cGen. John W. Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said the bomb was \u2018the right munition\u2019 to use against the Islamic State because of the group\u2019s use of roadside bombs, bunkers and tunnels.\u201d The bomb is known as the GBU-43 and is one of the largest airdropped munitions in the U.S. military\u2019s inventory \u2013 for comparison, U.S. aircraft commonly drop bombs that weigh between 250 to 2,000 pounds. The last time it was almost used was 2003 in the opening salvos of the Iraq war.\n\n\"The U.S. has targeted similar complexes and dropped tens of thousands of bombs in Afghanistan, raising the question of why a bomb of this size was needed Thursday,\u201d our colleagues write. \u201cIt was unclear what the GBU-43 strike accomplished, as the bomb is not designed to penetrate hardened targets such as bunkers or cave complexes.\u201d The bomb comes just one week after the Pentagon ordered a high-profile strike in Syria.\n\n-- Afghan officials said Friday that the bomb killed 36 Islamic State militants \u2013 a revelation that is likely to raise further questions about the decision to deploy the 22,000-pound device. No civilians were reported killed.\n\n-- Trump praised the operation Thursday as another success for \"MY military,\" a formulation that has alarmed some veterans who feel like the Armed Forces do not belong to any one man. \u201cWe have given them total authorization and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing and frankly that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been so successful lately,\u201d he said. Still, the president declined to say whether he personally approved the Afghanistan strike -- a question also dodged by Sean Spicer in Thursday's press briefing. \u201cWhat I do is I authorize my military,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\n-- The bombing also raises a bigger, more critical, question: what is Trump\u2019s strategy in Afghanistan? \u201cDuring the 2016 campaign, candidates scarcely mentioned the war in Afghanistan, [and] the Trump administration has yet to spell out its broader strategy in a conflict that U.S. military commanders have called a stalemate. \u2026 On Wednesday, Trump said his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, would be visiting Afghanistan soon. Central Command commander Gen. Joseph Votel has hinted at requesting thousands of more U.S. troops to help buoy the fledgling Afghan military.\u201d\n\nA member of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is made up of U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab fighters, stands guard near the village of Bir Fawaz, 20 clicks north of Raqa. (Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- Meanwhile: Aircraft from the U.S.-led coalition accidently bombed friendly Syrian forces on Tuesday, the Pentagon said, leaving 18 dead in what is the worst confirmed friendly-fire incident in the war against ISIS militants. Thomas Gibbons-Neff reports: \u201cThe coalition said in a statement that the airstrike was requested by \u2018partnered forces\u2019 near the town of Tabqa who accidentally targeted a group of Kurdish and Arab fighters known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. The partnered forces believed that the SDF\u2019s position belonged to the Islamic State, the statement said. According to a U.S. official \u2026 an SDF unit in close proximity to the Islamic State defense lines reported its location incorrectly. When other SDF forces saw what they thought were Islamic State fighters, they ordered a strike\u2013but it turned out to be on the SDF fighters who had provided the wrong location.\u201d Before this week\u2019s incident, U.S.-led forces had acknowledged two friendly-fire events in the fight against ISIS, occurring in December 2015 and January 2016. Pentagon officials said the coalition is reviewing the incident and will \u201cimplement appropriate safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future.\u201d Multiple nations, including Belgium, Denmark and Australia, participate in the air war against the Islamic State, and it is unclear whether any country besides the U.S. was involved in Tuesday\u2019s errant strike.\n\nGreg Walden holds a town hall meeting in The Dalles, Oregon, on Wednesday. (Stephanie Yao Long/The Oregonian via AP)\n\nOBAMACARE:\n\n-- \u201cRepublican House leader avoids selling GOP health-care plan at home,\u201d by Paige Winfield Cunningham: \u201cRep. Greg Walden is one of the Republican House leaders who crafted the measure to overhaul the health-care system \u2026 But when faced with a large crowd of angry constituents in his district this week, the Oregon Republican seemed reluctant to claim the legislation as his own \u2026 [instead stressing the parts] of the Affordable Care Act that he wants to keep. That did not stop about 1,500 of his constituents who packed this liberal area at two town halls on Wednesday from slamming the congressman for wanting to overhaul Obamacare in a state that heavily relies on it. \u2018Why don\u2019t you go back to Washington, [and] in the spirit of bipartisanship, grow a pair, sit down with Nancy Pelosi and say, \u2018Let\u2019s fix Obamacare,\u2019' said one middle-aged man \u2026 Like many House Republicans, Walden has spent the past seven years attacking Obamacare and promising to repeal and replace it if the GOP secured one-party rule in Washington. But now that Walden has his wish, eliminating Obamacare is proving extremely difficult and politically dangerous.\"\n\n-- \u201cTrump\u2019s threat prompts Democrats to play hardball over Obamacare payments,\u201d by Mike DeBonis: \u201cDemocrats signaled that they will seek to secure payments owed to health insurers under the Affordable Care Act as part of pending negotiations over a government spending bill Thursday \u2014 a new wrinkle in sensitive talks that emerged a day after [Trump] threatened to use the payments to force Democrats to negotiate a replacement for the ACA. The \u2018cost-sharing reduction\u2019 payments are meant to subsidize out-of-pocket expenses for low-income Americans who receive insurance through ACA marketplaces, and the payments are seen as a key factor in maintaining the stability of the market for individual insurance in many states. House Republicans sued the administration of President Barack Obama over the payments, and they have been tied up in litigation for months as insurers have warned that the impasse could threaten coverage for many Americans. Two Democratic aides \u2026 said Trump\u2019s remarks have now put the issue among the party\u2019s top priorities as they negotiate a spending bill. Current federal appropriations expire April 28, and a partial government shutdown would follow if Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on how to extend funding.\u201d\n\nPUNDITS WEIGH IN ON SYRIA:\n\n-- Post columnist David Ignatius says Trump got a \u201ctaste of success\u201d in Syria because he has assembled a competent national security team \u2013 and is listening to its advice: \u201cThere was a consensus among his top advisers for a quick, limited strike on a Syrian air base, and Trump took the recommendation. He didn\u2019t amplify, augment or otherwise disrupt it with his own tweets. He allowed the process to work. Comity reigns in part because Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson hammer out common positions before every meeting in the Situation Room. \u2026 [And] the Trump team, for now, is basking in self-congratulation. Yes, [Trump\u2019s new approach] brings him closer to the foreign policy mainstream that he and Bannon derided during the campaign. But it also gives him a taste of the success he craves.\u201d\n\n-- Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer says \u201cAmerica demonstrated its capacity for swift, decisive action\": \u201cIt took Trump 63 hours to make Assad pay for his chemical-weapons duplicity. ... And in defense, mind you, of an abstract international norm \u2014 a rationale that dramatically overrides the constraints of America First. The larger lesson is this: In the end, national interest prevails. Populist isolationism sounds great, rouses crowds and may even win elections. But contra White House adviser Stephen Bannon, it\u2019s not a governing foreign policy for the United States. \u2026 This is not to say that things could not change tomorrow. We\u2019ve just witnessed one about-face. With a president who counts unpredictability as a virtue, he could well reverse course again. For now, however, the traditionalists are in the saddle.\u201d\n\nMarine Le Pen attends a rally this week near Troyes, France. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters)\n\nFOR YOUR RADAR -- NINE DAYS UNTIL THE FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL VOTE:\n\n-- New York Times, \u201cLe Pen\u2019s Inner Circle Fuels Doubt About Bid to \u2018Un-Demonize\u2019 Her Party,\u201d by Adam Nossiter: \u201cLittle more than a week before France\u2019s presidential election, Marine Le Pen remains a front-runner after working hard to sanitize the image of her party, the National Front, and to distance it from the uglier associations of Europe\u2019s far right. But descriptions of the inner workings of her party by present and former close Le Pen associates, as well as court documents, raise fresh doubts about the success and sincerity of those efforts. Even before Ms. Le Pen\u2019s remarks this week denying France\u2019s culpability in a notorious wartime roundup of Jews, recent revelations in the French news media \u2026 revived nagging concerns about the sympathies of the woman who would be France\u2019s next president. Two men in her innermost circle \u2014 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chatillon and Axel Loustau \u2014 are well-known former members of a violent, far-right student union that fought pitched battles with leftists and took a turn toward Hitler nostalgia in the mid-1990s. They are longtime associates of Ms. Le Pen since her days in law school in the 1980s and remain among her closest friends.\u201d\n\n-- From The Economist: \u201c[Le Pen] is unlikely to become president; France\u2019s two-round system inoculates against extremist parties like her National Front. Polls find her losing the run-off by wide margins against all potential challengers. But like the meteor that wiped out Tyrannosaurus Rex, her victory would be a low-probability, high-impact event. \u2026 Ms Le Pen aims to withdraw France from the euro, the EU\u2019s passport-free Schengen area, and possibly the EU itself. The EU can cope with small troublemakers like Hungary or Greece. But to lose a large founding member would throw its future into question. Betting markets rate her chances between 20-25%; the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, puts them at nearly 40%. These are not numbers that should let Europe sleep easy.\u201d\n\nA family pulls a wagon of groceries across the storm-damaged Highway 1 that has made Big Sur \"an island.\" (David Royal/AP)\n\nWAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n-- \u201cBig Sur usually can\u2019t keep people away. Right now, it\u2019s practically deserted,\u201d by Sara Solovitch: An estimated two million tourists flock to Big Sur annually just to drive Highway 1, the route that cuts through Big Sur on California\u2019s scenic Central Coast. \u201cBut today [they] are gone and Highway 1 is car-free, home instead to pickup basketball games, mothers pushing strollers, and skateboarders whizzing by \u2026 The \u2018island\u2019 of Big Sur \u2014 for that\u2019s what this iconic stretch of coastline has become \u2014 is entering its ninth week of nearly total isolation, thanks to punishing winter storms, landslides and a failed bridge. The rain \u2026 left Highway 1 cut off from the rest of California, with few services for the 450 men, women and children who live here. That means no mail delivery, a limited supply of gasoline, and a single deli where you can buy eggs. Legendary restaurants and businesses have been temporarily shuttered and the majority of their staffs laid off. Workers are dipping into 401(k) accounts just to pay their rent. Even the resident monks have been forced to pass around the modern-day collection plate known as GoFundMe \u2026 For the time being, the only way in and out is a grueling hike, a pricey helicopter ride or an otherwise closed road to the south that is accessible briefly in the morning and again in the afternoon.

(Steve Helber/AP)\n\n-- Smart frame --> \u201cThere\u2019s a word that no longer describes the federal appeals court in Richmond: Conservative,\u201d by Anne E. Marimow: \u201cA portfolio of Southern cases, genteel courtroom traditions and years of forceful conservative rulings shape the enduring image of the federal appeals court in Richmond. But the bench has shed its conservative label, undergoing a sea change in the past decade, and is poised to have an immediate impact on the fledgling Trump administration. Starting next month, the full court will take up the president\u2019s entry ban for immigrants from some countries, followed by the case of a transgender teen whose battle to use a boy\u2019s bathroom challenges the president\u2019s new policy. Since taking office, [Trump] has harshly criticized federal judges \u2026 as in \u2018chaos\u2019 and \u2018turmoil.\u2019 Yet the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, a Richmond-based venue the administration might once have found reliably hospitable, now has a higher proportion of judges tapped by Democrats than most of the nation\u2019s 13 circuit courts. A test of how far the 4th Circuit bench has tilted left will come May 8.

As they looked toward a world where pariahs like Iran and Cuba were won over with diplomacy, they fell victim to a sneak attack by an old adversary.

It Took Him Two Years To Convict Just One,\u201d from HuffPost: \u201cNearly two years after getting the authority to prosecute voter fraud, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach announced Wednesday he had obtained his first conviction of a non-citizen who had voted. Kobach, who has made the unsubstantiated claim that millions of non-citizens could be registered to vote across the country, said that Victor David Garcia-Bebek, had pleaded guilty to voter fraud and illegally voted in a 2012 special and general election, as well as a 2014 general election. Kobach had pushed for prosecutorial authority, arguing he needed it to crack down on voter fraud. However, from 1997 to 2010, there were only 11 confirmed cases of it in Kansas. There were 1,788,673 registered voters in the state \u2026 During a February interview on Fox Business Network, Kobach cited an unnamed \u2018expert\u2019 as saying as many as 18,000 non-citizens could be on the voting rolls in Kansas, but conceded that he believed only a fraction of that number were actually voting in elections.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cNew York to provide lawyers for immigrants facing deportation,\u201d from CNN: \u201cUndocumented immigrants in New York who can't afford a lawyer and are facing deportation will soon have access to free legal counsel. The New York governor's office said last week that it is allocating $10 million in its fiscal 2018 budget toward creating a legal defense fund \u2018to ensure all immigrants, regardless of residency status, have access to representation.\u2019 Unlike U.S. citizens, undocumented immigrants don't have the right to free legal counsel. Called the Liberty Defense Project, the funding is part of a public-private partnership with the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Ford Foundation.

Sasse made the case to a group called the Gospel Coalition that America\u2019s identity is bound up in an idea, not a piece of land or any racial group. \u201cAmerican exceptionalism was never a claim about ethnicity. American exceptionalism was never a claim about Americans\u2019 unique anthropology,\u201d Sasse said in Indianapolis. \u201cAmerican exceptionalism was an understanding about the historical moment in
