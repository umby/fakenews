He tried stretching out his right leg, knowing these waits can take hours, and winced. He couldn\u2019t sit easily for long, not anymore, and so he took a sip of soda and again thought about what he should do.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He hadn\u2019t had a full-time job in a year. He was skipping meals to save money. He wore jeans torn open in the front and back. His body didn\u2019t work like it once had. He limped in the days, and in the nights, his hands would swell and go numb, a reminder of years spent hammering nails. His right shoulder felt like it was starting to go, too.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">        <div class=\"note pull-right col span4\">\n            <p> <strong>Disabled America:</strong> </p>\n<p>Between 1996 and 2015, the number of working-age adults receiving federal disability payments increased dramatically across the country \u2014 but nowhere more so than in rural America.

He picked it up, said hello and hung up \u2014 another debt collector. He rubbed his right knee. Maybe it would get better. Maybe he would still find a job.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">            <div class=\"span4 col pull-right right-content  bTB1S-phone padTB30\">\n                <!--BOX AD 0 BEGIN-->\n                <div id=\"slug_bigbox\" data-ad-type=\"bigbox\" style=\"display:none;\" class=\"padTB10 advertisement\"></div>\n                <!--BOX AD 0 END-->\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"span8 col\">\n<p class=\"indented\">His mother had written a number the night before and told him to call it, and he had told her he\u2019d think about it. She wanted him to apply for disability, like she had, like his girlfriend had, and like his stepfather, whom he now saw shuffling out of the pain clinic, hunched over his walker, reaching for a hand-rolled cigarette. Spencer got out of the truck. He lit his own.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cRemember we were talking about it last night?\u201d he asked Gene Ruby. \u201cRemember we were talking about signing up?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ruby, 64.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cRemember Mama said there was a number you got to call?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cShe\u2019s got the number,\u201d Ruby said. \u201cThe Social Security number.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">Spencer kept asking questions. What would Social Security want to know? How often are people denied? But he didn\u2019t mention the one that had been bothering him the most lately: Was he a failure?</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cThere\u2019s a stigma about it,\u201d Spencer said, thinking aloud. \u201cDisabled. Disability. Drawing a check. But if you\u2019re putting food on the table, does it matter?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">Then: \u201cI could probably still work.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He put his stepfather\u2019s walker in the truck bed, got behind the wheel, started another cigarette and, pulling out of the pain clinic\u2019s parking lot, headed for home.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">                                        <div class=\"span12 bTB1S marT10 padTB30 bTB1S\">\n            \n                        <div class=\"photo-full temp-pad\">\n                    <div class=\"spinner\">\n            <img class=\"lazy-image image \"data-original=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/wp-content/themes/wapo-blogs/inc/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/03/bigdog.jpg&authapi-mob-redir=0\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/themes/enterprise-theme-nav/images/pixel.png?authapi-mob-redir=0\"  />\n                    </div>\n                    \n            \n        </div>\n\n                                                <div class=\"marT10\">\n                                            <p class=\"marTB0 light-grey size-fourteen franklin-light\">\n                                                    Desmond Spencer, 39, and his girlfriend, Tasha Harris, 34, hang out at the house they share with Spencer's mother and stepfather in Beaverton, Ala.                                                                        </p>\n                                    </div>\n                            \n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"span8 marT30 col\">\n<p class=\"indented\">The decision that burdened Desmond Spencer was one that millions of Americans have faced over the past two decades as the number of people on disability has surged.

The federal government this year will spend an estimated $192\u00a0billion on disability payments, more than the combined total for food stamps, welfare, housing subsidies and unemployment assistance.</p>\n<p>The rise in disability has emerged as yet another indicator of a widening political, cultural and economic chasm between urban and rural America.</p>\n</div></div><div

working-age adults live on monthly disability checks, according to a Washington Post analysis of Social Security Administration statistics.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">Rural America experienced the most rapid increase in disability rates over the past decade, the analysis found, amid broad growth in disability that was partly driven by demographic changes that are now slowing as disabled baby-boomers age into retirement.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">The increases have been worse in working-class areas, worse still in communities where residents are older, and worst of all in places with

Eighteen of the counties were majority black, but the remaining counties were, on average, 87\u00a0percent white. In the 2016 presidential election, the majority-white counties voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, whose rhetoric of a rotting nation with vast joblessness often reflects lived experiences in these communities.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">Most people aren\u2019t employed when they apply for disability \u2014 one reason applicant rates skyrocketed during the recession. Full-time employment would, in fact, disqualify most applicants. And once on it, few ever get off, their ranks uncounted in the national unemployment rate, which doesn\u2019t include people on disability.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">The decision to apply, in many cases, is a decision to effectively abandon working altogether. For the severely disabled, this choice is, in essence, made for them. But for others, it\u2019s murkier. Aches accumulate. Years pile up. Job prospects diminish.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cWhat drives people to [apply for] disability is, in many cases, the repeated loss of work and inability to find new employment,\u201d said David Autor, an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied rising disability rates. \u201cMany people who are applying would say, \u2018Look, I would like to work, but no

He steered through Walker County, where nearly one in five working-age adults are on disability, and into Lamar County, where the disability rate has more than doubled over the past 20 years, arriving in the town of Beaverton, population 273, where even the 55-year-old mayor is drawing a disability check.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He pulled up to a small house alongside a quiet country road, got out and looked around. There was only forest and hills and sun. \u201cMan, I love it out here,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cAin\u2019t going nowhere,\u201d Ruby agreed.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">Spencer, who wears mud-caked boots and camouflage and brags of burning trash \u201clike a proper redneck,\u201d has grown so enamored of rural life that he\u2019s sometimes surprised when he remembers that he spent most of his life elsewhere. He grew up just outside of Peoria, Ill., dropped out of school at 14, secured his GED, served two stints in prison for felony burglary before he turned 20 and started working roofing jobs, following other family members into manual labor, like his grandfather who built bridges, and his mother, who worked at a stove factory.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">His work as a roofer had been a constant thread through his life, from one state to the next, one job to another. And so it had been again in 2005 when he followed family members to Lamar County, which is 86\u00a0percent white and 11\u00a0percent black, and was then navigating a long decline in population and manufacturing jobs \u2014 one plant moved to Mexico, another to the Dominican Republic. He nonetheless found a roofing job quickly, settling into a life that, for a time, felt as safe as it was comfortable. But then came the recession, and the uneven recovery, and jobs started drying up, and four years ago, as the county poverty rate climbed to 24\u00a0percent, the roofing company let him go.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He figured he\u2019d find more work right away. But weeks became months, and he started doing what he calls \u201codds and ends\u201d \u2014 work as a welder, a ranch hand, even a full-time garbage collector \u2014 but nothing restored the stability that had gone missing.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He opened the front door to his house. He walked past a small sign in a living room cabinet that said, \u201cBELIEVE in the beauty of your dreams,\u201d and into a bathroom that he had recently remodeled and where another sign said, \u201cDON\u2019T QUIT: Stick to the fight when you\u2019re hardest hit; it\u2019s when things seem worst that you must not quit.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He had been reading a book lately about the power of positivity. He would sometimes think about it when putting in job applications, or when he was behind his house, looking at his possessions. There was the old Kia that hadn\u2019t run in two years. The pile of aluminum cans for which he\u2019d make 40 cents on the pound. The dozens of used tires a repair shop had paid him to haul away.

His knee was hurting once more, as it had on and off ever since he fell from a roof during a construction job two years ago. He\u2019d never had it checked out because he\u2019d never had insurance, and he didn\u2019t mention it now because everyone at the house seemed worse off than he was. His mother, Karen Ruby, 60, who has cirrhosis of the liver, was sitting at the kitchen table with her head in her hands, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to be able to get back into church.\u201d His stepfather was stooped beside her, next to a wheelchair, smoking a cigarette.

Spencer has not been able to find full-time work for more than a year and is applying for disability. \u201cIt ain't nothing to be proud of, really,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing to work every day and coming home, you know, that\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d        \n              </div>\n              </div>\n                  </div>\n        <div class=\"span8 marT30 col\">\n<p class=\"indented\">This is how Spencer spends most of his days, ferrying to the dollar store and back, collecting soda, cigarettes and whatever else his family may want, and consoling them when he\u2019s around. Most days he doesn\u2019t mind. He likes feeling like the strong one when it seems as though almost everyone he knows is either applying for or already on disability. Just the night before, during a family dinner, it had struck him again.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cShe walks, and it breaks her bones,\u201d his cousin, who applied for disability after a nervous breakdown, had said of another relative receiving disability.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cShe falls a lot,\u201d added his aunt, who collects $733 monthly in disability checks because of back pain.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">                <div class=\"span12 bTB1S marT10 no-border graphic bg-none graphicPadTB30\" id=\"raw\">\n        <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/314937376&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>        </div>\n                <div class=\"span8 marT30 col\">\n<p class=\"indented\">Spencer, listening to the conversation, had looked around.

He didn\u2019t know how many times he\u2019d gone in that upholstery factory and asked about a job, any job, and was turned away. He saw another factory, this one an equipment supplier, where he thought he\u2019d need an act of Congress to get hired. Up ahead was a horse-trailer shop. Three consecutive months he had gone through the door, and each time they\u2019d said, \u201cNext month, try us.\u201d Meanwhile, he tried to sign up for a welding class at a community college, but failed the enrollment math exam.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He pulled up to the Piggly-Wiggly. He collected cake mix and three 12-packs of Mountain Dew for Harris, who he knows can go through 24 cans in a day, and was driving home, passing everywhere he couldn\u2019t get a job, when he thought of another opportunity. There was still that place that might need help with welding, a skill he\u2019d picked up after he lost his roofing job. He had told himself he\u2019d go first thing on Monday morning. Arrive by 8:30 a.m. Show the enthusiasm and dedication of someone worth hiring.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">Walking back into his house, he placed the cake mix on the counter and heard his mother, who was in her room, with the curtains drawn and the television on, holding an unlit cigarette.</p>\n<p>\u201cDesmond?\u201d she said, her voice raspy from a case of strep throat. \u201cIs that black lighter in there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlack lighter?\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got a sore throat,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it,\u201d he said of the lighter.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cMe and Gene, neither of us got a lighter now,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He began placing empty soda cans into a plastic bin and clearing the kitchen table of the dishes from the night before, then heard Harris at the bottom of the steps.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cBaby?\u201d she said. \u201cMy head is still killing me.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cI got you something for your headache,\u201d he said, handing her some medicine and a 12-pack of Mountain Dew, and went back to the kitchen.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cDesmond,\u201d Harris softly called after him.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cYeah?\u201d he said, returning.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cDo you have a cigarette?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He gave her one, finished with the kitchen, then limped to the living room. He lowered himself onto the couch, his knee hurting worse than earlier, and flipped on the television.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">Something had to change.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">        <div class=\" marT10\">\n          <div class=\"span12    bTB1S padTB30\">\n              <div class=\"row\">\n                              <div class=\"span6 package-photo  marT0 marT0small\">\n                <div class=\"spinner\">\n                    <img class=\"lazy-image image\"  data-original=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/wp-content/themes/wapo-blogs/inc/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/03/cigarettes.jpg&authapi-mob-redir=0\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/themes/enterprise-theme-nav/images/pixel.png?authapi-mob-redir=0\" />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n                    <div class=\"span6 package-photo package-photo-small marT0 marT0small marT12small\">\n                <div class=\"spinner\">\n                    <img class=\"lazy-image image\"  data-original=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/wp-content/themes/wapo-blogs/inc/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/03/bar.jpg&authapi-mob-redir=0\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/themes/enterprise-theme-nav/images/pixel.png?authapi-mob-redir=0\" />\n                </div>\n            </div>\n                      </div>\n          </div>\n                        <div class=\"span4 col pull-right\">\n              <div class=\"marT30 marT10small light-grey size-fourteen franklin-light\">\n                  Left, Desmond Spencer, who trims filters with pliers to make cigarettes stronger, said that he and his mother plan to quit smoking soon.

Don\u2019t be ashamed of being on disability.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">You\u2019re a grown man, his stepfather said. Bring in some money.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">That was what Spencer was thinking about \u2014 money, and not having any \u2014 when one day Harris found him sitting alone on the back porch in the quiet, going through another cigarette. \u201cChecks are in,\u201d she said of his parents\u2019 monthly disability payments, which are cumulatively worth $3,616 and support everyone in a house that, at that moment, was low on just about everything.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to the store,\u201d Harris said.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cHow you getting there?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cThe truck.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cIt ain\u2019t got no gas, though.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cI got to take your mom to the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cMaybe she\u2019ll loan you 10 for gas.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harris disappeared back into the house, and Spencer went back to his cigarettes and thoughts. It didn\u2019t seem right to him, living off his parents\u2019 disability checks and borrowing money from them. But he felt trapped. He couldn\u2019t leave Lamar County with his mother so sick. And the only money he had coming in was the monthly $425 an elderly friend paid him to tend his horses and keep him company on lonely afternoons, and it was never enough to cover everything. This month it was socks. Harris needed socks. And what kind of man can\u2019t afford socks? His grandfather used to tell him that a man isn\u2019t a man unless he owns land, and now here he was, years later, not feeling like one at all.</p>\n<p>He found Harris in the kitchen. \u201cAsk him for $40,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll get 10 more from him to buy socks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gene Ruby was at the computer when Spencer approached him. The question came quickly and quietly. \u201cCould I borrow 40? And give it back to you right here soon?\u201d he asked. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">            <div class=\"span4 col pull-right right-content  bTB1S-phone padTB30\">\n                <!--BOX AD 0 BEGIN-->\n                <div id=\"slug_bigbox_4\" data-ad-type=\"bigbox|4\" style=\"display:none;\" class=\"padTB10 advertisement\"></div>\n                <!--BOX AD 0 END-->\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"span8 col\">\n<p class=\"indented\">A few hours after pocketing the money, Spencer climbed back into the truck Gene made the payments on and started it with the gas Karen had paid for. Harris got in beside him. They had been together for seven years and rarely disagreed, except for that day two years before when Harris said she was thinking of applying for disability on account of back pain. He told her not to do it. People would look down on them. They would find jobs. Don\u2019t lose hope.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">A light blinked on the dashboard.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cTransmission\u2019s hot,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI told you it did that to me the other day.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He pressed down on the accelerator.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cJust put it in neutral and coast.

She could tell he was getting frustrated. Just about everything these days made him that way. He had begun complaining more, not just about the truck or the pain in his knees and hands, but about all of Lamar County. He told her there would never be jobs here for them. Maybe she had been right about applying for disability. His injuries weren\u2019t getting better, and he wasn\u2019t getting hired, and how much longer could he ask for help with groceries? Help with gas? Help with transportation? Help with everything?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">                <div class=\"span12 bTB1S marT10 no-border graphic bg-none graphicPadTB30\" id=\"raw\">\n        <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/314937874&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>        </div>\n                <div class=\"span8 marT30 col\">\n<p>He moved the truck out of neutral and back into drive.

Harris\u2019s sister-in-law, Chastity, who was working full time at a calling center, came outside. Then followed Harris\u2019s brother, Josh, 28, broad-shouldered and shirtless.

I got this job.\u2019\u00a0\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">There was a moment of quiet.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cI\u2019m glad you got that, man,\u201d Spencer said again. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s just the right place at the right time.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">Spencer and Harris finished the barbecue, hugged their relatives goodbye and got back into the truck. He drove to a strip mall that had a Shoppers Value Foods, a Check Into Cash and a title loan shop. He glanced at a sign outside a Sonic fast-food restaurant: \u201cNow Hiring All Shifts.\u201d He sometimes considered applying for a fast-food job. But how, after making $20 an hour at some jobs, could he take one paying $7.25?</p>\n<p>He parked and went inside the grocery store.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">                                        <div class=\"span12 bTB1S marT10 padTB30 bTB1S\">\n            \n                        <div class=\"photo-full temp-pad\">\n                    <div class=\"spinner\">\n            <img class=\"lazy-image image \"data-original=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/wp-content/themes/wapo-blogs/inc/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/03/howlingdog.jpg&authapi-mob-redir=0\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/themes/enterprise-theme-nav/images/pixel.png?authapi-mob-redir=0\"  />\n                    </div>\n                    \n            \n        </div>\n\n                                                \n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"span8 marT30 col\">\n<p class=\"indented\">Spencer was looking at a piece of paper on the coffee table. It was the number to the Social Security office his mother had given him. He and Harris sat on the couch in the living room, and she handed him a telephone.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cYou got to call,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to reach through the phone and get you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, just held the phone.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cWhat do I do and say?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cCall that number and do whatever they tell you to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>He took in a breath and exhaled slowly.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cI guess I\u2019ll call,\u201d he said, punching in the number, and then came a voice on the other end, with that question again, the one he rarely had the courage to ask himself:</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cAre you disabled?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cHow long have you been disabled?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cTwo years.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cHow are you supporting yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cLiving off my mom.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cIs this a permanent disability?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cUhh,\u201d he began. \u201cI don\u2019t think .\u2009.\u2009. \u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He looked at the floor and leaned forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s getting no better.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He scheduled an appointment for an interview at the local Social Security office the following month. He hung up, stood and, appearing dazed, told Harris, \u201cI didn\u2019t like it at all.\u201d She gave him a sympathetic look and left him alone on the couch.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">He was there again four days later on a Monday morning.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">The entire house was dark. Spencer was in his pajamas, watching television. Harris was soon beside him, also in pajamas. \u201cI think I\u2019m getting sick,\u201d she said, and he didn\u2019t answer. She went to another room and came back with Ruby\u2019s laptop, which she uses every Monday morning to look at job listings.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cI ain\u2019t checked it in a week,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cOh my God,\u201d he sighed, flipping through channels.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cDo you know anything about pop-ups?\u201d she asked, looking at the computer. \u201cMan, I\u2019ve had, like, a hundred pop-ups.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cLook, the new \u2018Walking Dead,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Spencer said, coming to another channel.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">She pulled up her email and clicked on one that listed service positions within 25 miles. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cHere we go.\u201d She saw three postings: \u201cCustomer Service/Telecommute,\u201d \u201cTelecommute Consultant\u201d and \u201cProduct Tester.\u201d She didn\u2019t investigate any of them, instead going back to her inbox. She found another email with more listings.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cErber?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have an Erber place around here.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cUber,\u201d Spencer said.</p>\n<p>\u201cUber, Erber, whatever,\u201d she said, closing the computer.</p>\n<p>An hour passed, then another, and Spencer stayed on the couch. He would not apply for the welding job today. He wanted to focus on securing disability.</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\u201cI got to go get dressed,\u201d he said, looking down at his clothing. \u201cWhat a loser.\u201d</p>\n<p>He returned in torn jeans and, with nothing better to do, went outside. He limped to the truck and fiddled with jumper cables. He set a fire inside an iron bin and burned some trash. He inspected a sheet of aluminum he had found, wondering how much he could sell it for. He walked into the woods and walked out. He looked at the road. A car hadn\u2019t passed in a long while. It was 1 in the afternoon. The day already felt over.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">                <div class=\"span4 col pull-right right-content no-border graphic bg-none graphicPadTB30\" id=\"raw\">\n        <!-- Updated 12/7/15 by EY to fix a bug with single quotes --> \r\n\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"//css.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/enterprise-raw-code/sharebar/enterprise-sharebar.css?v3\" />\r\n\r\n<!-- To switch to grayscale share buttons, remove the 'color-top' class from top-sharebar-wrapper div -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"top-sharebar-wrapper color-top large-8 large-centered columns cf\" id=\"top-sharebar_123534312321\">\r\n<div class=\"social-tools-wrapper\">\r\n    <div class=\"social-tools-primary \">\r\n        <div class=\"social-tools \">\r\n            <!-- FB -->\r\n            <a id=\"facebook-raw-share\" data-service=\"facebook\" onclick=\"\" tabindex=\"1\">\r\n                <div class=\"facebook tool first mobile\"><span class=\"hideText\">Share on Facebook</span><span class=\"fa fa-facebook-square\"></span></div>\r\n            </a>\r\n            <!-- Twitter -->\r\n            <a id=\"twitter-raw-share\" data-service=\"twitter\" onclick=\"\" tabindex=\"2\">\r\n                <div class=\"twitter tool mobile\"><span class=\"hideText\">Share on Twitter</span><span class=\"fa fa-twitter\"></span></div>\r\n            </a>\r\n            <!-- Google Plus -->\r\n            <a id=\"google-plus-raw-share\" data-service=\"google-plus\" onclick=\"\" tabindex=\"3\">\r\n                <div class=\"google-plus tool mobile\"><span class=\"hideText\">Share on Google Plus</span><span class=\"fa fa-google-plus\"></span></div>\r\n            </a>\r\n            <!-- Email -->\r\n            <a id=\"email-raw-share\" data-service=\"email\" href=\"\" tabindex=\"4\">\r\n                <div class=\"email tool mobile\"><span class=\"hideText\">Share via Email</span><span class=\"fa fa-envelope\"></span></div>\r\n            </a>\r\n            <!-- More -->\r\n            <a onclick=\"return false;\">\r\n                <div class=\"more last tool mobile\"><span class=\"hideText\" tabindex=\"5\">More Options</span><span class=\"fa fa-plus\"> </span></div>\r\n            </a>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"social-tools-additional\">\r\n        <div class=\"social-tools \">\r\n            <!-- LinkedIn -->\r\n<!--             <a id=\"linkedIn-raw-share\" data-service=\"linkedin\" onclick=\"\" tabindex=\"6\">\r\n                <div class=\"linkedin tool mobile first\"><span class=\"hideText\">Share on LinkedIn</span><span class=\"fa fa-linkedin\"></span></div>\r\n            </a> -->\r\n            <!-- Pinterest -->\r\n            <a id=\"pinterest-raw-share\" data-service=\"pinterest\" onclick=\"\" tabindex=\"7\">\r\n                <div class=\"pinterest tool mobile first\"><span class=\"hideText\">Share on Pinterest</span><span class=\"fa fa-pinterest\"></span></div>\r\n            </a>\r\n            <!-- Tumblr  -->\r\n            <a id=\"tumblr-raw-share\" data-service=\"tumblr\" onclick=\"\" tabindex=\"8\">\r\n                <div class=\"tumblr tool mobile last\"><span class=\"hideText\">Share on Tumblr</span><span class=\"fa fa-tumblr\"></span></div>\r\n            </a>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        </div>\n                <div class=\"span8 col\">\n\n</div></div><div class=\"row\">        <div class=\"note pull-right col span4\">\n            <p> <strong>About the data:</strong> <br />\nThere are 13 million working-age Americans \u2014 ages 18 to 64 \u2014 receiving disability payments. This number includes every working-age person who receives benefits through the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program or both. The Social Security Administration publishes those numbers for the nation for each year dating to 1996. An annual rate was calculated using working-age Americans.<br />\nThe Washington Post calculated the disability prevalence rate among the working-age population at the county level. The Social Security Administration publishes county recipients of SSI, SSDI disability and SSDI for disabled adult children. The SSA also publishes county-level counts of people receiving support under SSI and SSDI. Those figures were subtracted to avoid double counting. The rate was created with the county working-age population.<br />\nThe Post classified counties from urban to rural using qualifications defined by the six-step scale of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. Counties were grouped into three sets to divide metro areas with at least 1 million people, smaller metro areas and non-metro areas.</p>\n<p>Spending figures were taken from the proposed 2017 federal budget and SSA\u2019s projected payments for 2017. Social Security Disability Insurance ($149 billion) was combined with Supplemental Security Income for people with disabilities ($43 billion). The spending does not include money states spent to supplement the programs.</p>\n<p>Five-year data from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey were used for county-level demographics.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"span8 col\">\n<link href=\"//css.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/sub/css/wp-story-style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n<div

It was the number to the Social Security office his mother had given him. He and Harris sat on the couch in the living room, and she handed him a telephone.\n\n\u201cYou got to call,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to reach through the phone and get you.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, just held the phone.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do and say?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cCall that number and do whatever they tell you to do.\u201d\n\nHe took in a breath and exhaled slowly.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll call,\u201d he said, punching in the number, and then came a voice on the other end, with that question again, the one he rarely had the courage to ask himself:\n\n\u201cAre you disabled?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been disabled?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo years.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you supporting yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cLiving off my mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this a permanent disability?\u201d\n\n\u201cUhh,\u201d he began. \u201cI don\u2019t think . . . \u201d\n\nHe looked at the floor and leaned forward.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s getting no better.\u201d\n\nHe scheduled an appointment for an interview at the local Social Security office the following month. He hung up, stood and, appearing dazed, told Harris, \u201cI didn\u2019t like it at all.\u201d She gave him a sympathetic look and left him alone on the couch.\n\nHe was there again four days later on a Monday morning.\n\nThe entire house was dark. Spencer was in his pajamas, watching television. Harris was soon beside him, also in pajamas. \u201cI think I\u2019m getting sick,\u201d she said, and he didn\u2019t answer. She went to another room and came back with Ruby\u2019s laptop, which she uses every Monday morning to look at job listings.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t checked it in a week,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d he sighed, flipping through channels.\n\n\u201cDo you know anything about pop-ups?\u201d she asked, looking at the computer. \u201cMan, I\u2019ve had, like, a hundred pop-ups.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, the new \u2018Walking Dead,\u2019 \u201d Spencer said, coming to another channel.\n\nShe pulled up her email and clicked on one that listed service positions within 25 miles. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cHere we go.\u201d She saw three postings: \u201cCustomer Service/Telecommute,\u201d \u201cTelecommute Consultant\u201d and \u201cProduct Tester.\u201d She didn\u2019t investigate any of them, instead going back to her inbox. She found another email with more listings.\n\n\u201cErber?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have an Erber place around here.\u201d\n\n\u201cUber,\u201d Spencer said.\n\n\u201cUber, Erber, whatever,\u201d she said, closing the computer.\n\nAn hour passed, then another, and Spencer stayed on the couch. He would not apply for the welding job today. He wanted to focus on securing disability.\n\n\u201cI got to go get dressed,\u201d he said, looking down at his clothing. \u201cWhat a loser.\u201d\n\nHe returned in torn jeans and, with nothing better to do, went outside. He limped to the truck and fiddled with jumper cables. He set a fire inside an iron bin and burned some trash. He inspected a sheet of aluminum he had found, wondering how much he could sell it for. He walked into the woods and walked out. He looked at the road. A car hadn\u2019t passed in a long while. It was 1 in the afternoon. The day already felt over.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/graphics/ai2html/disabled-america/disability-lines-280.jpg?c=53", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/themes/enterprise-theme-nav/images/wp_full_white.png", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/themes/enterprise-theme-nav/images/wp_logo_white.png", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/03/decidedisabledsocialcardshare3-new.jpg", "http://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/wp-content/themes/enterprise-theme-nav/images/pixel.png?authapi-mob-redir=0", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/graphics/ai2html/disabled-america/disability-maps-280.jpg?c=135"], "videos": []}
