And it would become the largest prescription-drug case the agency has pursued.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the DEA and federal prosecutors would contend that the company ignored its responsibility to report suspicious orders as 500 million of its pills ended up in Florida between 2008 and 2012 \u2014 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state. Government investigators alleged in internal documents that the company\u2019s lack of due diligence could have resulted in nearly 44,000 federal violations and exposed it to $2.3 billion in fines, according to confidential government records and emails obtained by The\u00a0Washington Post.</p>\n<p>But six years later, after four investigations that spanned five states, the government has taken no legal action against Mallinckrodt. Instead, the company has reached a tentative settlement with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Under the proposal, which remains confidential, Mall<span id=\"U11801053326409zoB\">inckrodt would agree to pay a $35\u00a0million fine and admit no wrongdoing.</span>\n</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409NkH\">\u201cMallinckrodt\u2019s response was that \u00ad\u2018everyone knew what was going on in Florida but they had no duty to report it,\u2019\u2009\u201d according to an internal summary of the case prepared by federal prosecutors and obtained by The Post.</p>\n<div class=\"bottom-ad--bigbox\"><div id=\"slug_bigbox_1\" data-ad-type=\"bigbox|1\" style=\"display:none;\"></div><div id=\"slug_mob_bigbox_1\" data-ad-type=\"mob_bigbox|1\" style=\"display:none;\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409lLB\">The case shows how difficult it is for the government to hold a drug manufacturer responsible for the damage done by its product. DEA investigators appalled by rising overdose deaths said they worked for years to build the biggest case of their careers only to watch it falter on uncertain legal territory and in the face of stiff resistance from the company.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409sMG\">\u201cThey just weren\u2019t taking this seriously, and people were dying,\u201d said a former law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending. \u201cPeople were dying all over the place. It wasn\u2019t their kids, their wives, their husbands, their brothers. It was some hillbilly in Central Florida, so who cares?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409gnF\">In a statement, a Mallinckrodt spokesman said the company has worked hard to fight drug diversion.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409FG\">\u201cMallinckrodt has long been a recognized leader in developing and sharing best practices related to the prevention of opioid diversion and misuse, and has continuously invested significant resources to address this serious drug epidemic,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are proud of the programs and initiatives we\u2019ve developed to ensure appropriate use of pain medication and, most importantly, to deter such medications from ending up in the wrong hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409WF\">Officials at the DEA declined to comment for this article. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, which is handling the case, issued a statement. \u201cOur office works diligently to use all the legal tools available to us to hold corporations responsible for their actions,\u201d acting U.S. attorney Daniel Lemisch said. \u201cThis is particularly true in a highly regulated industry such as the manufacture of opioids. As this case is still in settlement negotiations, we cannot comment on the specifics of the matter.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"inline-content inline-graphic-embedded\">\n\n</div>\n<div id='g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-box' class='ai2html'>\n\t<!-- Generated by ai2html v0.55 - 2017-03-31 - 18:12 -->\n\t<!-- ai file: dea-mallinckrodt-chain -->\n\n\t<style type='text/css' media='screen,print'>\n\t\t.g-artboard {\n\t\t\tmargin:0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\t</style>\n\n\n\t<style type='text/css' media='screen,print'>\n\t\t/* Custom CSS block 1 */\n\t\t\n\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-980 {\n\t\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\t\tmargin:0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-600,\n\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280 {\n\t\t\tdisplay:none;\n\t\t\tmargin:0 auto;\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\t@media (max-width: 1140px) {\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-980 {\n\t\t\t\tdisplay:none;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-600 {\n\t\t\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t }\n\t\t\n\t\t@media (max-width: 650px) {\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-600 {\n\t\t\t\tdisplay:none;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280 {\n\t\t\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t }\n\t</style>\n\n\t<!-- Artboard: 280 -->\n\t<div id='g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280' class='g-artboard '>\n\t\t<style type='text/css' media='screen,print'>\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280{\n\t\t\t\tposition:relative;\n\t\t\t\toverflow:hidden;\n\t\t\t\twidth:280px;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t.g-aiAbs{\n\t\t\t\tposition:absolute;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t.g-aiImg{\n\t\t\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\t\t\twidth:100% !important;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280 p{\n\t\t\t\tfont-family:FranklinITCProLight,FranklinITCStdLight,'Franklin Gothic','ITC Franklin Gothic',Arial,sans-serif;\n\t\t\t\tfont-size:13px;\n\t\t\t\tline-height:18px;\n\t\t\t\tmargin:0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280 .g-aiPstyle0 {\n\t\t\t\tfont-family:FranklinITCProBold,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;\n\t\t\t\tfont-size:18px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-transform:uppercase;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align:center;\n\t\t\t\tletter-spacing:0.16666666666667em;\n\t\t\t\tcolor:#000000;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280 .g-aiPstyle1 {\n\t\t\t\tfont-family:FranklinITCProBold,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;\n\t\t\t\tfont-size:16px;\n\t\t\t\tline-height:19px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align:center;\n\t\t\t\tcolor:#000000;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280 .g-aiPstyle2 {\n\t\t\t\tfont-family:FranklinITCProLight,FranklinITCStdLight,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;\n\t\t\t\tfont-size:15px;\n\t\t\t\tline-height:17px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align:center;\n\t\t\t\tpadding-bottom:5px;\n\t\t\t\tcolor:#000000;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280 .g-aiPstyle3 {\n\t\t\t\tfont-family:FranklinITCProLight,FranklinITCStdLight,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;\n\t\t\t\tfont-size:15px;\n\t\t\t\tline-height:17px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align:center;\n\t\t\t\tcolor:#000000;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280 .g-aiPstyle4 {\n\t\t\t\tfont-family:FranklinITCProLight,FranklinITCStdLight,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;\n\t\t\t\tfont-size:11px;\n\t\t\t\tline-height:13px;\n\t\t\t\tcolor:#000000;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t</style>\n\t\t<div id='g-dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280-graphic'>\n\t\t\t<img id='g-ai0-0_dea-mallinckrodt-chain'\n\t\t\t\tclass='g-aiImg'\n\t\t\t\tsrc='img/dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280.jpg?c=365'\n\t\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t<div id='g-ai0-1_dea-mallinckrodt-chain' class='g-content g-aiAbs' style='top:0.6800%;left:51.1968%;width:99.3209%;margin-left:-49.6605%;'>\n\t\t\t\t<p class='g-aiPstyle0'>The path of </p>\n\t\t\t\t<p class='g-aiPstyle0'>a pain pill</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div id='g-ai0-2_dea-mallinckrodt-chain' class='g-content g-aiAbs' style='top:16.8858%;left:50.0002%;width:92.7138%;margin-left:-46.3569%;'>\n\t\t\t\t<p class='g-aiPstyle1'>Manufacturers</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p class='g-aiPstyle2'>The oxycodone pill&rsquo;s journey begins at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.

When suspicious orders occur, companies must immediately notify the agency or risk losing their DEA licenses to sell or manufacture controlled substances, as well as face civil and criminal penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409alE\">According to the documents and sources familiar with the settlement talks, Mallinckrodt was willing to acknowledge its responsibility to report suspiciously large orders placed by its customers, a network of wholesale distributors. But the company said that it should not be held responsible for what happens to its drugs once the distributors send them to their customers, such as doctors and pharmacies. Mallinckrodt contended that the DEA has never required manufacturers to know their customers\u2019 customers and that the agency provided the company with conflicting advice about its responsibilities under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409kgG\">\u201cMallinckrodt took unprecedented steps beyond the legal obligations of a manufacturer. Mallinckrodt began monitoring downstream sales between wholesalers and pharmacies, and proactively informed both its customers and the DEA of its findings,\u201d said Brien T.

href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/the-dea-slowed-enforcement-while-the-opioid-epidemic-grew-out-of-control/2016/10/22/aea2bf8e-7f71-11e6-8d13-d7c704ef9fd9_story.html?utm_term=.de44c95c3809\" shape=\"rect\" target=\"_blank\">reported in October</a> that the DEA\u2019s civil and administrative enforcement efforts against the mammoth wholesale distributors that deliver painkillers to pharmacies stalled in the face of a stepped-up lobbying campaign by the drug industry.</p>\n<p id=\"U118010533264090CF\">The Mallinckrodt case was something different: an aggressive attempt to hold a drug manufacturer accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409q6H\">Mallinckrodt was founded 150 years ago in St. Louis and became the leading supplier of chemicals for the emerging photography industry. Now based in the United Kingdom after corporate acquisitions, Mallinckrodt is one of the nation\u2019s largest manufacturers of oxycodone, a powerful opioid made from the natural painkiller found in poppies.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409c1F\">\u201cWhen you get to the manufacturing level, it\u2019s hard to prove that they knew what was happening,\u201d another law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. \u201cBut they were making the product, they were selling it to the country\u2019s largest distributors, and they had a responsibility under the law to detect and report orders that were suspicious. These orders were beyond suspicious.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"pullout\">\nThe DEA and federal prosecutors contended that Mallinckrodt manufactured <span>500 million pills</span> that ended up in Florida between 2008 and 2012 \u2014 <span>66 percent of all oxycodone</span> sold in the state.\n</div>\n<img class=\"divider\" src=\"img/pills_divider.png\">\n<h2 id=\"the-investigation-begins\" class=\"subhead\"> The investigation begins</h2>\n<p id=\"U1180105332640903C\">The first hint that Mallinckrodt might pose a problem for the DEA came not from Florida but from Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"U118010533264095KH\">On July 7, 2009, members of a Tennessee drug task force in a sting operation seized several 100-tablet bottles of \u00adMallinckrodt-made oxycodone. Task force agents alerted Mallinckrodt. The company\u2019s lot numbers were printed on the labels, allowing for easy tracking of the pills.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409bHD\">Three days later, Mallinckrodt responded that the oxycodone had been prescribed by Barry Schultz, a doctor who ran a medical clinic in Delray Beach, Fla.

People involved in the case still call the gathering \u201cthe earthquake meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409N5D\">DEA officials showed the company the remarkable amounts of its oxycodone going to distributors and the number of arrests being made for oxycodone possession and distribution on the street, according to one participant in the meeting who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409BQE\">\u201cThere were a lot of follow-ups, and they said they would adjust their practices,\u201d the participant said.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409IkB\">The next day, the DEA\u2019s chief regulatory officer wrote to the agency\u2019s investigators and a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, Leslie Wizner, an assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"U118010533264094VH\">\u201cI think we can all agree that yesterday\u2019s meeting was an eye opener for the company, and very successful, on so many levels, from DEA\u2019s perspective,\u201d Barbara J. Boockholdt wrote in an email obtained by The Post. She noted that there were \u201cpending and proposed investigations\u201d of Mallinckrodt.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409KCG\">Boockholdt declined to comment. Wizner did not return calls requesting an interview.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409TgE\">Three weeks after the Aug. 23 meeting, Mallinckrodt notified 43 of its distributors that they would no longer receive rebates from the company if they continued to supply certain pharmacies whose orders appeared to be suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409t8\">But by then, the DEA and federal prosecutors had decided to take the investigation of the company to another level.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409bPG\">On Nov. 30, 2011, the DEA served a subpoena on Mallinckrodt, demanding\u00a0documents related to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, according to the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<div class=\"pullout\">\nProsecutors said that the Mallinckrodt drugs that Sunrise sent to Schultz in the <span>six weeks</span> after Mallinckrodt was notified of the Tennessee sting were worth nearly <span>$2.8 million</span> on the street.\n</div>\n<img class=\"divider\" src=\"img/pills_divider.png\">\n\n<h2 id=\"confidence-grows\" class=\"subhead\"> Confidence grows</h2>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409mKI\">The subpoena brought a windfall of information. The DEA gained access to data from Mallinckrodt\u2019s rebate or \u201cchargeback\u201d program, an industry-wide practice that provides reimbursements to wholesale distributors. That information and other records showed where Mallinckrodt\u2019s oxycodone was going \u2014 from the company to its network of distributors to retailers down the chain.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409EMC\">The significance of the Tennessee case started to become clear.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409MLI\">The DEA learned that in the six weeks after the Tennessee task force alerted Mallinckrodt to the drugs found in the 2009 sting operation, the company had shipped another 2.1\u00a0million tablets of oxycodone to Sunrise, the Florida distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409VC\">The DEA also discovered that Sunrise, over an 11-month period, had sent at least 92,400 tablets to Schultz, the Delray Beach doctor who prescribed the pills found in Tennessee. In one day, he had prescribed 1,000 tablets to one patient.</p>\n<p id=\"U1180105332640952C\">At the time, the street value of oxycodone was $30 a tablet.

The Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office had arrested Schultz, charging him with drug trafficking and manslaughter because one of his patients died of a drug overdose.

Investigators documented scores of alleged violations, including the failure to secure narcotics, to keep accurate records or to document transfers of drugs, according to a confidential memo obtained by The Post.</p>\n<div class=\"pullout\">\nProsecutors said they considered <span>43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious</span> \u2014 orders that Mallinckrodt should have reported to the DEA.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409W3C\">Prosecutors also acknowledged the weaknesses of their case in the summary. They noted that the DEA had provided conflicting guidance to Mallinckrodt about its responsibilities to report suspicious orders from retailers such as Schultz.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409s6E\">For example, Kleissle, the DEA supervisor in St. Louis, had told the company in 2010 after the Tennessee sting that it had a responsibility to keep close tabs on its customers, the distributors, as well as the distributor\u2019s customers, the pharmacies and doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409RuD\">But that same year, a DEA investigator in New York, Heather White, told \u00adMallinckrodt that no one in her region, including her supervisor, had heard anything about \u201cknow your customer\u2019s customer and that the regulations do not reflect such a requirement,\u201d according to the prosecutor\u2019s summary. White declined to comment for this article.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409gpF\">Mallinckrodt pushed back against the government\u2019s contention that it was responsible for the acts of downstream retail customers such as Schultz.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409RYC\">The company said during discussions with prosecutors that it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered. Mal\u00adlinckrodt also said that the DEA was aware of the company\u2019s increased sales of oxycodone and could have acted by reducing the amount of narcotics the company is permitted to sell. The DEA sets quotas for the quantities of controlled substances that can be manufactured. The company also complained that the DEA has not provided guidance on how to track suspicious orders.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409mFI\">\u201cMallinckrodt has agreed to pay a settlement amount relating to orders from its distributors,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the summary. \u201cHowever, it refuses to negotiate any settlement relating to the downstream customers orders.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"bottom-ad--bigbox\"><div id=\"slug_bigbox_4\" data-ad-type=\"bigbox|4\" style=\"display:none;\"></div><div id=\"slug_mob_bigbox_4\" data-ad-type=\"mob_bigbox|4\" style=\"display:none;\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409fDI\">The company put together a \u00adhigh-powered legal team to fight on its behalf. It included O\u2019Connor, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in fraud and corruption cases, and D. Linden Barber, a former associate chief counsel for the DEA\u2019s diversion division who was one of the architects of the agency\u2019s crackdown on the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409q6C\">Following negotiations between Mallinckrodt\u2019s legal team and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, prosecutors dropped the civil conspiracy allegation, according to sources close to the talks. The negotiations then focused on the relationship between Mallinckrodt and its distributors, their customers and the amount of drugs that were going to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409ZiE\">Prosecutors noted that the DEA had twice placed the industry on notice about its responsibility to report suspicious orders. They also said Mallinckrodt was aware of enforcement actions the agency had taken against distributors for failing to report the inordinate amounts of painkillers they were shipping to retail customers in states such as Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409SiH\">\u201cWith respect to distributor orders,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a document, \u00ad\u201cMallinckrodt\u2019s obligations to monitor and notify of suspicious sales were known to the company.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"pullout\">\nFor a company the size of Mallinckrodt, a <span>$35 million fine is \u201cchump change,\u201d</span> one government official said. In fiscal 2016, the company posted $3.4 billion in revenue and a <span>$489 million profit</span>.\n</div>\n<img class=\"divider\" src=\"img/pills_divider.png\">\n<h2 id=\"about-more-than-money\" class=\"subhead\"> About more than money</h2>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409gbF\">On July 10, 2015, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office sent a proposed settlement offer to lawyers for Mallinckrodt.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409FZH\">Prosecutors said that they could fine the company as much as $2.3 billion because 222,107 orders to Florida were \u201cexcessive\u201d and should have been reported as suspicious. Or they could fine the company up to $1.3 billion based on an analysis of the 217,022,834 Mallinckrodt 30 mg oxycodone tablets that were sold for cash in Florida in 2009 and 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409cPB\">\u201cAs you are aware, significant cash sales are an indication of diversion,\u201d prosecutors wrote in their offer.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409f0H\">But the big buildup resulted in a much smaller proposed fine. Despite the billion-dollar figures bandied about, the prosecutors proposed settling the case for $70\u00a0million. They cited the \u201clitigation risk\u201d they faced if the case went to trial, Mallinckrodt\u2019s previous legal arguments and the size of other recent settlements with drug distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409wwG\">This year, on Feb. 7, Mallinckrodt told its shareholders in an SEC filing that the investigation \u201cwill not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition\u201d because it has set aside the money.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409G0F\">Sources close to the negotiations said that the two sides had recently reached a tentative agreement to settle the case for $35 million. With final approval pending from the Justice Department, some of those who worked on the case said they are deeply disappointed by the dollar amount of the proposed fine.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409oSB\">Drug manufacturers have paid much larger fines for other misdeeds. Glaxo\u00adSmithKline was fined $3 billion, and Pfizer was fined $2.3 billion for illegally promoting off-label drug use and paying kickbacks to doctors. Purdue Pharma paid a $600 million fine, and three of its executives pleaded guilty to charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the risks of the painkiller that is widely blamed for setting off the nation\u2019s opioid crisis: OxyContin. All of those cases were initiated by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409SlF\">The largest fine the DEA has levied against a drug distributor was the $150\u00a0million that McKesson, the nation\u2019s largest drug wholesaler, recently agreed to pay following allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of painkillers.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409UYD\">For a company the size of Mallinckrodt, a $35 million fine is \u201cchump change,\u201d one government official said.</p>\n<p id=\"U11801053326409ar\">\u201cThe problem you have is this was new ground, and it had never been done before,\u201d said another former law enforcement official with knowledge of the case. \u201cThere was a lot of back and forth over whether we could pull this off. Is it ideal? No. Is this a number that everyone wants to see? No. People would probably like to see more. But this is about more than money. It\u2019s about holding a manufacturer accountable, and it will put the industry on notice.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"trailer\"></p><p class=\"tagline\">Alice Crites contributed to this

But the DEA\u2019s case against it faltered.\n\nTo combat an escalating opioid epidemic, the Drug Enforcement Administration trained its sights in 2011 on Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, one of the nation\u2019s largest manufacturers of the highly addictive generic painkiller oxycodone.\n\nIt was the first time the DEA had targeted a manufacturer of opioids for alleged violations of laws designed to prevent diversion of legal narcotics to the black market. And it would become the largest prescription-drug case the agency has pursued.\n\nUltimately, the DEA and federal prosecutors would contend that the company ignored its responsibility to report suspicious orders as 500 million of its pills ended up in Florida between 2008 and 2012 \u2014 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state. Government investigators alleged in internal documents that the company\u2019s lack of due diligence could have resulted in nearly 44,000 federal violations and exposed it to $2.3 billion in fines, according to confidential government records and emails obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nBut six years later, after four investigations that spanned five states, the government has taken no legal action against Mallinckrodt. Instead, the company has reached a tentative settlement with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Under the proposal, which remains confidential, Mallinckrodt would agree to pay a $35 million fine and admit no wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cMallinckrodt\u2019s response was that \u00ad\u2018everyone knew what was going on in Florida but they had no duty to report it,\u2019 \u201d according to an internal summary of the case prepared by federal prosecutors and obtained by The Post.\n\nThe case shows how difficult it is for the government to hold a drug manufacturer responsible for the damage done by its product. DEA investigators appalled by rising overdose deaths said they worked for years to build the biggest case of their careers only to watch it falter on uncertain legal territory and in the face of stiff resistance from the company.\n\n\u201cThey just weren\u2019t taking this seriously, and people were dying,\u201d said a former law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending. \u201cPeople were dying all over the place. It wasn\u2019t their kids, their wives, their husbands, their brothers. It was some hillbilly in Central Florida, so who cares?\u201d\n\nIn a statement, a Mallinckrodt spokesman said the company has worked hard to fight drug diversion.\n\n\u201cMallinckrodt has long been a recognized leader in developing and sharing best practices related to the prevention of opioid diversion and misuse, and has continuously invested significant resources to address this serious drug epidemic,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are proud of the programs and initiatives we\u2019ve developed to ensure appropriate use of pain medication and, most importantly, to deter such medications from ending up in the wrong hands.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the DEA declined to comment for this article. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, which is handling the case, issued a statement. \u201cOur office works diligently to use all the legal tools available to us to hold corporations responsible for their actions,\u201d acting U.S. attorney Daniel Lemisch said. \u201cThis is particularly true in a highly regulated industry such as the manufacture of opioids. As this case is still in settlement negotiations, we cannot comment on the specifics of the matter.\u201d\n\nThe path of a pain pill Manufacturers The oxycodone pill\u2019s journey begins at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.

When suspicious orders occur, companies must immediately notify the agency or risk losing their DEA licenses to sell or manufacture controlled substances, as well as face civil and criminal penalties.\n\nAccording to the documents and sources familiar with the settlement talks, Mallinckrodt was willing to acknowledge its responsibility to report suspiciously large orders placed by its customers, a network of wholesale distributors. But the company said that it should not be held responsible for what happens to its drugs once the distributors send them to their customers, such as doctors and pharmacies. Mallinckrodt contended that the DEA has never required manufacturers to know their customers\u2019 customers and that the agency provided the company with conflicting advice about its responsibilities under the law.\n\n\u201cMallinckrodt took unprecedented steps beyond the legal obligations of a manufacturer. Mallinckrodt began monitoring downstream sales between wholesalers and pharmacies, and proactively informed both its customers and the DEA of its findings,\u201d said Brien T. O\u2019Connor, a lawyer for the company. \u201cThe company continues to enhance its anti-diversion programs to this day.\u201d\n\nThe proposed $35 million settlement comes as the nation\u2019s prescription opioid epidemic continues to worsen, with nearly 180,000 lives lost to overdoses since 2000.\n\nDeaths from prescription opioid overdose continue to rise in US 15,281 15,000 The highest year on record, prescription opioids killed an average of 42 people a day. 10,000 5,000 3,785 0 2000 2015 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention GABRIEL FLORIT/THE WASHINGTON POST\n\nThe Post reported in October that the DEA\u2019s civil and administrative enforcement efforts against the mammoth wholesale distributors that deliver painkillers to pharmacies stalled in the face of a stepped-up lobbying campaign by the drug industry.\n\nThe Mallinckrodt case was something different: an aggressive attempt to hold a drug manufacturer accountable.\n\nMallinckrodt was founded 150 years ago in St. Louis and became the leading supplier of chemicals for the emerging photography industry. Now based in the United Kingdom after corporate acquisitions, Mallinckrodt is one of the nation\u2019s largest manufacturers of oxycodone, a powerful opioid made from the natural painkiller found in poppies.\n\n\u201cWhen you get to the manufacturing level, it\u2019s hard to prove that they knew what was happening,\u201d another law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. \u201cBut they were making the product, they were selling it to the country\u2019s largest distributors, and they had a responsibility under the law to detect and report orders that were suspicious. These orders were beyond suspicious.\u201d\n\nThe DEA and federal prosecutors contended that Mallinckrodt manufactured 500 million pills that ended up in Florida between 2008 and 2012 \u2014 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state.\n\nThe investigation begins\n\nThe first hint that Mallinckrodt might pose a problem for the DEA came not from Florida but from Tennessee.\n\nOn July 7, 2009, members of a Tennessee drug task force in a sting operation seized several 100-tablet bottles of \u00adMallinckrodt-made oxycodone. Task force agents alerted Mallinckrodt. The company\u2019s lot numbers were printed on the labels, allowing for easy tracking of the pills.\n\nThree days later, Mallinckrodt responded that the oxycodone had been prescribed by Barry Schultz, a doctor who ran a medical clinic in Delray Beach, Fla. The company said that one of its distributors, Sunrise Wholesale of Broward County, Fla., had sent 20,400 tablets of oxycodone to Schultz in the previous year.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health had just issued an administrative complaint against Schultz for prescribing oxycodone outside \u201cthe course of his professional practice.\u201d His medical office had become a thoroughfare for those seeking easy access to drugs, records show.\n\nOn July 27, a Mallinckrodt security director told DEA Supervisor Paul \u201cPete\u201d Kleissle in St. Louis about the Tennessee connection. Kleissle recommended that Mallinckrodt conduct an audit of Sunrise and the company agreed, government documents show.\n\nThe investigation seemed to stall there, but the events in Tennessee would later prove significant.\n\nAt the time, the DEA\u2019s Diversion Control Division was ramping up enforcement efforts against the nation\u2019s wholesale drug distributors \u2014 including Sunrise \u2014 warning them and drug manufacturers that they would be held accountable if they failed to report suspicious orders. Under the DEA\u2019s \u201cdistributor initiative,\u201d the agency had begun to make cases against large and small wholesalers.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, DEA investigators in several states started to see large amounts of Mallinckrodt\u2019s oxycodone being sent to Florida.\n\nBy then, Mallinckrodt\u2019s blue \u00ad30-milligram oxycodone tablets had become so popular among drug users and dealers that they had a street name \u2014 \u201cM\u2019s,\u201d for the company\u2019s distinctive block-letter logo.\n\nKeySource Medical, based in Cincinnati, sent 41 million tablets of Mallinckrodt-made oxycodone to Florida in 2010, documents show. One of the pharmacies KeySource supplied was Tru-Valu Drugs in Lake Worth. With lines out the door and security measures such as a guard dog, left, and guns, Tru-Valu came under investigation by the DEA. (Federal court records)\n\nFlorida\u2019s lax laws, dishonest doctors and unscrupulous pharmacists had turned the state into ground zero for the nation\u2019s prescription opioid crisis.\n\nOne distributor that caught the attention of the DEA for sending drugs to Florida was KeySource Medical, a regional company based in Cincinnati. In 2010, it sent 41 million tablets of Mallinckrodt-made oxycodone to Florida, documents show. That was nearly 2.5 pills for every man, woman and child in the state.\n\nThe DEA accused KeySource in June 2011 of trying to conceal the amounts of drugs it was shipping by splitting its orders and told the company to halt its oxycodone shipments.\n\nMallinckrodt\u2019s oxycodone cropped up again when the DEA looked at one of the nation\u2019s three largest drug distributors, Cardinal Health, which was sending vast quantities to four pharmacies in Florida.\n\nThe DEA had seen enough.\n\nFlorida\u2019s drug overdose deaths, county by county Prescription opioids have played a key role in Florida\u2019s drug epidemic.

People involved in the case still call the gathering \u201cthe earthquake meeting.\u201d\n\nDEA officials showed the company the remarkable amounts of its oxycodone going to distributors and the number of arrests being made for oxycodone possession and distribution on the street, according to one participant in the meeting who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of follow-ups, and they said they would adjust their practices,\u201d the participant said.\n\nThe next day, the DEA\u2019s chief regulatory officer wrote to the agency\u2019s investigators and a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, Leslie Wizner, an assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit.\n\n\u201cI think we can all agree that yesterday\u2019s meeting was an eye opener for the company, and very successful, on so many levels, from DEA\u2019s perspective,\u201d Barbara J. Boockholdt wrote in an email obtained by The Post. She noted that there were \u201cpending and proposed investigations\u201d of Mallinckrodt.\n\nBoockholdt declined to comment. Wizner did not return calls requesting an interview.\n\nThree weeks after the Aug. 23 meeting, Mallinckrodt notified 43 of its distributors that they would no longer receive rebates from the company if they continued to supply certain pharmacies whose orders appeared to be suspicious.\n\nBut by then, the DEA and federal prosecutors had decided to take the investigation of the company to another level.\n\nOn Nov. 30, 2011, the DEA served a subpoena on Mallinckrodt, demanding documents related to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, according to the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nProsecutors said that the Mallinckrodt drugs that Sunrise sent to Schultz in the six weeks after Mallinckrodt was notified of the Tennessee sting were worth nearly $2.8 million on the street.\n\nConfidence grows\n\nThe subpoena brought a windfall of information. The DEA gained access to data from Mallinckrodt\u2019s rebate or \u201cchargeback\u201d program, an industry-wide practice that provides reimbursements to wholesale distributors. That information and other records showed where Mallinckrodt\u2019s oxycodone was going \u2014 from the company to its network of distributors to retailers down the chain.\n\nThe significance of the Tennessee case started to become clear.\n\nThe DEA learned that in the six weeks after the Tennessee task force alerted Mallinckrodt to the drugs found in the 2009 sting operation, the company had shipped another 2.1 million tablets of oxycodone to Sunrise, the Florida distributor.\n\nThe DEA also discovered that Sunrise, over an 11-month period, had sent at least 92,400 tablets to Schultz, the Delray Beach doctor who prescribed the pills found in Tennessee. In one day, he had prescribed 1,000 tablets to one patient.\n\nAt the time, the street value of oxycodone was $30 a tablet. The Mallinckrodt drugs that Sunrise sent to Schultz after Mallinckrodt was notified of the Tennessee sting were worth nearly $2.8 million on the street, prosecutors said.\n\nBarry Schultz, a doctor who ran a medical clinic in Delray Beach, Fla., was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2016. He was charged with drug trafficking and manslaughter after one of his patients died of an overdose. (Bruce R. Bennett/Palm Beach Post)\n\nProsecutors were becoming increasingly confident in their case. Under pressure from the DEA, Sunrise had surrendered its license to distribute narcotics. The Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office had arrested Schultz, charging him with drug trafficking and manslaughter because one of his patients died of a drug overdose. Schultz was later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n\n\u201cMallinckrodt knew through law enforcement reports that Barry Schultz was diverting controlled substances, and that the diverted oxycodone was supplied by Mallinckrodt through Sunrise,\u201d prosecutors later wrote in an internal document sent to the company. \u201cWhen Mallinckrodt continued to distribute oxycodone to Sunrise for such purposes, and continued to pay incentives in the form of chargebacks for the product sales to Barry Schultz, Mallinckrodt was diverting oxycodone.\u201d\n\nIn Oct. 22, 2012, the DEA served Mallinckrodt with another subpoena for records relating to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, the company disclosed in SEC filings.\n\nThose filings also showed that the DEA was examining Mallinckrodt\u2019s plant in Hobart, N.Y., about 70 miles southwest of Albany. Investigators documented scores of alleged violations, including the failure to secure narcotics, to keep accurate records or to document transfers of drugs, according to a confidential memo obtained by The Post.\n\nProsecutors said they considered 43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious \u2014 orders that Mallinckrodt should have reported to the DEA. But the company said it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered.\n\nConflicting rules guidance\n\nIn 2014, Mallinckrodt, which is publicly traded and maintains its U.S. headquarters in St. Louis, notified its shareholders that it was under investigation by the federal government and had received subpoenas for documents.\n\nBut with no sign of civil action by the DEA, the company said it believed that \u201cthe ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d In fiscal 2016, the company posted $3.4 billion in revenue and a $489 million profit.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, the case against Mallinckrodt was growing more serious.\n\nProsecutors said in internal documents that they found the company\u2019s behavior so egregious that they initially considered framing it as a civil conspiracy.\n\n\u201cMallinckrodt did knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree with Sunrise and Barry Schultz to commit offenses against the United States,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a draft complaint against the company that was never filed. \u201cThat is, to knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully distribute, dispense or prescribe controlled substances, including but not limited to the Schedule II drug oxycodone 30 mg.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor, the Mallinckrodt lawyer, said that the draft document reflects \u201cdiscredited allegations made in the heat of negotiations in 2015\u201d and that the government and the company moved past those accusations.\n\n\u201cIn particular, it is wrong to suggest Mallinckrodt was involved in any conspiracy related to Dr. Barry Schultz and Sunrise Wholesale,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIn reality, Mallinckrodt worked with law enforcement to investigate potential diversion by the physician and to audit Sunrise, and, importantly, the DEA praised the company\u2019s handling of the investigation.\u201d\n\nProsecutors weighed the strengths and weaknesses of their case in an internal summary they prepared Aug. 7, 2014.\n\n\u201cWe will argue that thousands of orders from the distributors as well as tens of thousands of orders from these down-stream customers were suspicious because of the pattern of distribution to Florida,\u201d prosecutors wrote. In all, they said they considered 43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious \u2014 orders that Mallinckrodt should have reported to the DEA.\n\nA DEA agent walks out of the Cabana Pharmacy in Miami after raiding it along with police and the Florida Department of Health in October 2011.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nProsecutors also acknowledged the weaknesses of their case in the summary. They noted that the DEA had provided conflicting guidance to Mallinckrodt about its responsibilities to report suspicious orders from retailers such as Schultz.\n\nFor example, Kleissle, the DEA supervisor in St. Louis, had told the company in 2010 after the Tennessee sting that it had a responsibility to keep close tabs on its customers, the distributors, as well as the distributor\u2019s customers, the pharmacies and doctors.\n\nBut that same year, a DEA investigator in New York, Heather White, told \u00adMallinckrodt that no one in her region, including her supervisor, had heard anything about \u201cknow your customer\u2019s customer and that the regulations do not reflect such a requirement,\u201d according to the prosecutor\u2019s summary. White declined to comment for this article.\n\nMallinckrodt pushed back against the government\u2019s contention that it was responsible for the acts of downstream retail customers such as Schultz.\n\nThe company said during discussions with prosecutors that it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered. Mal\u00adlinckrodt also said that the DEA was aware of the company\u2019s increased sales of oxycodone and could have acted by reducing the amount of narcotics the company is permitted to sell. The DEA sets quotas for the quantities of controlled substances that can be manufactured. The company also complained that the DEA has not provided guidance on how to track suspicious orders.\n\n\u201cMallinckrodt has agreed to pay a settlement amount relating to orders from its distributors,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the summary. \u201cHowever, it refuses to negotiate any settlement relating to the downstream customers orders.\u201d\n\nThe company put together a \u00adhigh-powered legal team to fight on its behalf. It included O\u2019Connor, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in fraud and corruption cases, and D. Linden Barber, a former associate chief counsel for the DEA\u2019s diversion division who was one of the architects of the agency\u2019s crackdown on the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nFollowing negotiations between Mallinckrodt\u2019s legal team and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, prosecutors dropped the civil conspiracy allegation, according to sources close to the talks. The negotiations then focused on the relationship between Mallinckrodt and its distributors, their customers and the amount of drugs that were going to Florida.\n\nProsecutors noted that the DEA had twice placed the industry on notice about its responsibility to report suspicious orders. They also said Mallinckrodt was aware of enforcement actions the agency had taken against distributors for failing to report the inordinate amounts of painkillers they were shipping to retail customers in states such as Florida.\n\n\u201cWith respect to distributor orders,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a document, \u00ad\u201cMallinckrodt\u2019s obligations to monitor and notify of suspicious sales were known to the company.\u201d\n\nFor a company the size of Mallinckrodt, a $35 million fine is \u201cchump change,\u201d one government official said. In fiscal 2016, the company posted $3.4 billion in revenue and a $489 million profit .\n\nAbout more than money\n\nOn July 10, 2015, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office sent a proposed settlement offer to lawyers for Mallinckrodt.\n\nProsecutors said that they could fine the company as much as $2.3 billion because 222,107 orders to Florida were \u201cexcessive\u201d and should have been reported as suspicious. Or they could fine the company up to $1.3 billion based on an analysis of the 217,022,834 Mallinckrodt 30 mg oxycodone tablets that were sold for cash in Florida in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, significant cash sales are an indication of diversion,\u201d prosecutors wrote in their offer.\n\nBut the big buildup resulted in a much smaller proposed fine. Despite the billion-dollar figures bandied about, the prosecutors proposed settling the case for $70 million. They cited the \u201clitigation risk\u201d they faced if the case went to trial, Mallinckrodt\u2019s previous legal arguments and the size of other recent settlements with drug distributors.\n\nThis year, on Feb. 7, Mallinckrodt told its shareholders in an SEC filing that the investigation \u201cwill not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition\u201d because it has set aside the money.\n\nSources close to the negotiations said that the two sides had recently reached a tentative agreement to settle the case for $35 million. With final approval pending from the Justice Department, some of those who worked on the case said they are deeply disappointed by the dollar amount of the proposed fine.\n\nDrug manufacturers have paid much larger fines for other misdeeds. Glaxo\u00adSmithKline was fined $3 billion, and Pfizer was fined $2.3 billion for illegally promoting off-label drug use and paying kickbacks to doctors. Purdue Pharma paid a $600 million fine, and three of its executives pleaded guilty to charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the risks of the painkiller that is widely blamed for setting off the nation\u2019s opioid crisis: OxyContin. All of those cases were initiated by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe largest fine the DEA has levied against a drug distributor was the $150 million that McKesson, the nation\u2019s largest drug wholesaler, recently agreed to pay following allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of painkillers.\n\nFor a company the size of Mallinckrodt, a $35 million fine is \u201cchump change,\u201d one government official said.\n\n\u201cThe problem you have is this was new ground, and it had never been done before,\u201d said another former law enforcement official with knowledge of the case. \u201cThere was a lot of back and forth over whether we could pull this off. Is it ideal? No. Is this a number that everyone wants to see? No. People would probably like to see more. But this is about more than money. It\u2019s about holding a manufacturer accountable, and it will put the industry on notice.\u201d\n\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/dea-mallinckrodt-line-280.jpg?c=164", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/12/18/Investigative/Images/AP_586246832764.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/dea-mallinckrodt-chain-980.jpg?c=490", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/dea-mallinckrodt-chain-600.jpg?c=315", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/pills_divider.png", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/dea-mallinckrodt-2300.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/dea-mallinckrodt-map-280.jpg?c=408", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/dea_topimage.png", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/10/06/Others/Images/2016-10-06/DEAdiversion0161475797691.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/dea-mallinckrodt-map-600.jpg?c=31", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/dea_topimage_mobile.png", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/10/12/Investigative/Advance/Images/zumaamericasthree694812.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/dea-mallinckrodt/img/dea-mallinckrodt-chain-280.jpg?c=365", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png"], "videos": []}
