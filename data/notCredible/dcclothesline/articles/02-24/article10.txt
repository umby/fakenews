McCain <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/usa/378352-mccain-travel-syria-secret/\">also met with</a> the Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and crown prince Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. In addition, McCain also met with Kurdish fighters on the ground in Syria.</p>\n<p>On February 22, McCain\u2019s spokeswoman, Julie Tarallo, confirmed that McCain had made the trip, saying it was a \u201cvaluable opportunity to assess dynamic conditions on the ground in Syria and Iraq.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tarallo also praised Trump\u2019s order to require the Department of Defense to provide a plan for combating the Islamic State in Syria within thirty days. She said, \u201cSenator McCain looks forward to working with the administration and military leaders to optimize our approach for accomplishing ISIL\u2019s lasting defeat.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, the trip was organized with the help of the U.S. military.</p>\n<p>Curiously, (or, rather, typically), there were no catcalls of suspicion from the mainstream press nor were there suggestions that McCain had violated the Logan Act, even though he <!--more-->admitted he discussed the possibility of establishing \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria and \u201cstrategies\u201d for \u201cfighting ISIS\u201d in Syria with both Erdogan and international relations with the Saudi King and UAE crown prince.</p>\n<div class=\"sb-widget clearfix\"></div>\n<p>McCain was also present at the Munich Security Conference where he criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric regarding NATO and his lack of adequate warmongering during the first two months of his presidency. According to the <em>Associated Press</em>,</p>\n<blockquote><p>During a speech Friday at the Munich Security Conference, McCain delivered a withering critique of Trump\u2019s worldview as he lamented a shift in the U.S. and Europe away from the \u2018universal values\u2019 that forged the Western alliance 70 years ago.</p>\n<p>McCain on Monday welcomed Trump\u2019s selection of Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster to be his national security adviser, calling the pick an \u201coutstanding choice.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Back in 2013, McCain traveled to Syria illegally where he met with terrorists backed by the United States and NATO, even taking pictures with terrorist leaders and some of the most bloodthirsty commanders of the invasion. McCain received virtually no criticism for his open violation of various American laws (including the ones he voted for). However, when U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard and former Rep. Dennis Kucinich met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after having traveled to Syria in order to tour the country and see the realities of the destruction the war, both were ravaged in the press.</p>\n<p>McCain has had <a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2015/02/the-un-american-hero-crimes-of-john.html\">a long history of engaging in behavior</a> that would have long ago torpedoed the career of many politicians and resulted in the incarceration of any average American. Remarkably, however, it doesn\u2019t appear that age has slowed him down at all.</p>\n<h2><strong>McCain Dismisses Missing Military Personnel</strong></h2>\n<p>As Schanburg writes,As Sydney Schanburg wrote in his excellent article, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/mccain-and-the-pow-cover-up/\">The War Secrets Sen. John McCain Hides</a>,\u201d McCain was consistent, at least in his actions, in his refusal to allow any further attempts to discover and recover missing American POWs in Vietnam as well as even the possibility of allowing any further investigation as to the possibility that Americans were still being held captive. This is, of course, despite McCain\u2019s incessant reliance on his military service as some type of qualification for whatever his political position of the day might be.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But there was one subject that was off-limits, a subject the Arizona senator almost never brings up and has never been open about \u2014 his long-time opposition to releasing documents and information about American prisoners of war in Vietnam and the missing in action who have still not been accounted for. Since McCain himself, a downed Navy pilot, was a prisoner in Hanoi for 5 1/2 years, his staunch resistance to laying open the POW/MIA records has baffled colleagues and others who have followed his career.</p>\n<p>Critics say his anti-disclosure campaign, in close cooperation with the Pentagon and the intelligence community, has been successful. Literally thousands of documents that would otherwise have been declassified long ago have been legislated into secrecy.</p>\n<p>For example, all the Pentagon debriefings of the prisoners who returned from Vietnam are now classified and closed to the public under a statute enacted in the 1990s with McCain\u2019s backing. He says this is to protect the privacy of former POWs and gives it as his reason for not making public his own debriefing.</p>\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n<p>Many Vietnam veterans and former POWs have fumed at McCain for keeping these and other wartime files sealed up. His explanation, offered freely in Senate hearings and floor speeches, is that no one has been proven still alive and that releasing the files would revive painful memories and cause needless emotional stress to former prisoners, their families and the families of MIAs still unaccounted for. But what if some of these returned prisoners, as has always been the case at the conclusion of wars, reveal information to their debriefing officers about other prisoners believed still held in captivity? What justification is there for filtering such information through the Pentagon rather than allowing access to source materials? For instance, debriefings from returning Korean war POWs, available in full to the American public, have provided both citizens and government investigators with important information about other Americans who went missing in that conflict.</p>\n<p>Would not most families of missing men, no matter how emotionally drained, want to know? And would they not also want to know what the government was doing to rescue their husbands and sons? Hundreds of MIA families have for years been questioning if concern for their feelings is the real reason for the secrecy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Others, however, suspect that all of McCain\u2019s insistence in keeping the information classified revolves around whether or not releasing the debriefings would open the door to McCain\u2019s closet, suggesting that there skeletons lurking inside it that the Senator does not want falling out. Schanburg writes,</p>\n<blockquote><p>A smaller number of former POWs, MIA families and veterans have suggested there is something especially damning about McCain that the senator wants to keep hidden. Without release of the files, such accusations must be viewed as unsubstantiated speculation. The main reason, however, for seeking these files is to find out if there is any information in the debriefings, or in other MIA documents that McCain and the Pentagon have kept sealed, about how many prisoners were held back by North Vietnam after the Paris peace treaty was signed in January 1973. The defense and intelligence establishment has long resisted the declassification of critical records on this subject. McCain has been the main congressional force behind this effort.</p>\n<p>The prisoner return in 1973 saw 591 Americans repatriated by North Vietnam. The problem was that the U.S. intelligence list of men believed to be alive at that time in captivity \u2014 in Vietnam, Laos and possibly across the border in southern China and in the Soviet Union \u2014 was much larger.</p>\n<p>Possibly hundreds of men larger. The State Department stated publicly in 1973 that intelligence data showed the prisoner list to be starkly incomplete. For example, only nine of the 591 returnees came out of Laos, though experts in U.S. military intelligence listed 311 men as missing in that Hanoi-run country alone, and their field reports indicated that many of those men were probably still alive. Hanoi said it was returning all the prisoners it had.</p>\n<p>President Nixon, on March 29, 1973, seconded that claim, telling the nation on television: \u201cAll of our American POWs are on their way home.\u201d This discrepancy has never been acknowledged or explained by official Washington. Over the years in Washington, McCain, at times almost single-handedly, has pushed through Pentagon-desired legislation to make it impossible or much harder for the public to acquire POW/MIA information and much easier for the defense bureaucracy to keep it hidden.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then there is also the case of the Truth Bill. A relatively simple bill which stated that</p>\n<blockquote><p>[The] head of each department or agency which holds or receives any records and information, including live-sighting reports, which have been correlated or possibly correlated to United States personnel listed as prisoner of war or missing in action from World War II, the Korean conflict and the Vietnam conflict shall make available to the public all such records and information held or received by that department or agency. In addition, the Department of Defense shall make available to the public with its records and information a complete listing of United States personnel classified as prisoner of war, missing in action, or killed in action (body not returned) from World War II, the Korean conflict, and the Vietnam conflict.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As one might suspect, a Pentagon implicated in the abandonment of these soldiers thus vehemently opposed the bill.</p>\n<p>The bill was defeated in 1989. In 1991, it reappeared only to quickly disappear again. Although the interest from family members of the missing veterans as well as the American public had not necessarily waned, another bill was inserted in its place \u2013 The McCain Bill. As Schanburg describes,</p>\n<blockquote><p>This measure turned \u201cThe Truth Bill \u201d on its head. It created a bureaucratic maze from which only a fraction of the available documents could emerge. And it became law. So restrictive were its provisions that one clause actually said the Pentagon didn\u2019t even have to inform the public when it received intelligence that Americans were alive in captivity.</p>\n<p>First, it decreed that only three categories of information could be released, i.e., \u201cinformation \u2026 that may pertain to the location, treatment, or condition of\u201d unaccounted-for personnel from the Vietnam War. (This was later amended in 1995 and 1996 to include the Cold War and the Korean conflict.) If information is received about anything other than \u201clocation, treatment or condition,\u201d under this statute, which was enacted in December 1991, it does not get disclosed.</p>\n<p>Second, before such information can be released to the public, permission must be granted by the primary next of kin, or PNOK. In the case of Vietnam, letters were sent by the Department of Defense to the 2,266 PNOK. More than 600 declined consent (including 243 who failed to respond, considered under the law to be a \u201cno\u201d).</p>\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n<p>Finally, in addition to these hurdles and limitations, the McCain act does not specifically order the declassification of the information. Further, it provides the Defense Department with other justifications for withholding documents. One such clause says that if the information \u201cmay compromise the safety of any United States personnel \u2026 who remain not accounted for but who may still be alive in captivity, then the Secretary [of Defense] may withhold that record or other information from the disclosure otherwise required by this section.\u201d</p>\n<p>Boiled down, the preceding paragraph means that the Defense Department is not obligated to tell the public about prisoners believed alive in captivity and what efforts are being made to rescue them. It only has to notify the White House and the intelligence committees in the Senate and House. The committees are forbidden under law from releasing such information.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the McCain act is now being used to deny access to other sorts of records. For instance, part of a recent APBnews.com Freedom of Information Act request for the records of a mutiny on merchant marine vessel in the 1970s was rejected by a Defense Department official who cited the McCain act. Similarly, requests for information about Americans missing in the Korean War and declared dead for the last 45 years have been denied by officials who reference the McCain statute.</p>\n<p>In 1996, however, another bill appeared. Entitled the Missing Service Personnel Act, the bill attempted to force the Pentagon to do more and act faster to find and subsequently recover missing military service personnel. The bill contained measures that required very strict reporting requirements for these purposes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schanburg describes how McCain once again rode into town to destroy any potential that may have existed to discover existing missing personnel or any personnel who might become missing in the future. He writes,</p>\n<blockquote><p>McCain amended the heart out of the statute. For example, the 1995 version required a unit commander to report to his theater commander within two days that a person was missing and describe what rescue and recovery efforts were underway. The McCain amendments allowed 10 days to pass before a report had to be made.</p>\n<p>In the 1995 act, the theater commander, after receiving the MIA report, would have 14 days to report to his Cabinet secretary in Washington. His report had to \u201ccertify\u201d that all necessary actions were being taken and all appropriate assets were being used \u201cto resolve the status of the missing person.\u201d This section was stricken from the act, replaced with language that made the Cabinet secretary, not the theater commander, the recipient of the report from the field. All the certification requirements also were stricken.</p>\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n<p>In response, the backers of the original statute cited the Pentagon\u2019s stained record on MIA\u2019s and argued that military history had shown that speed of action is critical to the chances of recovering a missing man. Moving \u201cthe bureaucracy \u201d to Washington, they said, was merely a way to sweep the issue under a rug.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One final evisceration in the law was McCain\u2019s removal of all its enforcement teeth. The original act provided for criminal penalties for anyone, such as military bureaucrats in Washington, who destroy or cover up or withhold from families any information about a missing man. McCain erased this part of the law. He said the penalties would have a chilling effect on the Pentagon\u2019s ability to recruit personnel for its POW/MIA office.</p>\n<p>Schanburg points out how McCain has personally acted as the first line of defense against any who may suggest that POWs were left to their fate in Vietnam. McCain acts, on this issue especially, behind a carefully crafted but false veneer of patriotism and military service that appears to make him infallible in the eyes of many low information voters.</p>\n<p>Schanburg writes,</p>\n<blockquote><p>McCain does not deal lightly with those who disagree with him on any of these issues or who suggest that the evidence indeed shows that a significant number of prisoners were alive and cached away as future bargaining chips when he came home in the group of 591 released in 1973.</p>\n<p>Over the years, he has regularly vilified any group or person who keeps trying to pry out more evidence about MIAs. He calls them \u201choaxers\u201d and \u201ccharlatans \u201d and \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d He decries the \u201cbizarre rantings of the MIA hobbyists\u201d and describes them as \u201cindividuals primarily who make their living off of keeping the issue alive.\u201d Before he died last year of leukemia, retired Col. Ted Guy, a highly admired POW and one of the most dogged resisters in the camps, wrote an angry open letter to the senator in an MIA newsletter. In it, he said of McCain\u2019s stream of insults: \u201cJohn, does this include Senator Bob Smith and other concerned elected officials? Does this include the families of the missing where there is overwhelming evidence that their loved ones were \u2018last known alive? \u2019 Does this include some of your fellow POWs?\u201d</p>\n<p>Clearly, McCain likes dissent the way he likes his veterans \u2013 silent. This silence, for McCain, can come by any means necessary.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, McCain has been the biggest denier of all when it comes to the possibility that American soldiers were left on the battlefield. Schanburg states,</p>\n<blockquote><p>McCain has said again and again that he has seen no \u201ccredible\u201d evidence that more than a tiny handful of men might have been alive in captivity after the official prison return in 1973. He dismisses all of the subsequent radio intercepts, live sightings, satellite photos, CIA reports, defector information, recovered enemy documents and reports of ransom demands \u2014 thousands and thousands of pieces of information indicating live captives \u2014 as meaningless. He has even described these intelligence reports as the rough equivalent of UFO and alien sightings.</p>\n<p>In Congress, colleagues and staffers who have seen him erupt \u2014 in the open and, more often, in closed meetings \u2014 profess themselves confounded by his behavior. Insisting upon anonymity so as not to invite one of his verbal assaults, they say they have no easy way to explain why a former POW would work so hard and so persistently to keep POW/MIA information from coming out. Typical is the comment of one congressional veteran who has watched McCain over many years: \u201cThis is a man not at peace with himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some McCain watchers searching for answers point to his recently published best-selling autobiography, <em>Faith of My Fathers</em>, half of which is devoted to his years as a prisoner. In the book, he says he felt badly throughout his captivity because he knew he was being treated more leniently than his fellow POWs owing to his propaganda value as the son of Adm. John S. McCain II, who was then the CINCPAC \u2014 commander in chief of all U.S. forces in the Pacific region, including Vietnam. (His captors considered him a prize catch and nicknamed him the \u201cCrown Prince.\u201d)</p>\n<p>Also in the book, the Arizona Senator repeatedly expresses guilt and disgrace at having broken under torture and given the North Vietnamese a taped confession, broadcast over the camp loudspeakers, saying he was a war criminal who had, among other acts, bombed a school. \u201cI felt faithless and couldn\u2019t control my despair,\u201d he writes. He writes, revealing that he made two half-hearted attempts at suicide. Most tellingly, he said he lived in \u201cdread\u201d that his father would find out. \u201cI still wince,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I recall wondering if my father had heard of my disgrace.\u201d</p>\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n<p>But how would McCain\u2019s forced confession alone explain his endless campaign against releasing MIA/POW information?</p>\n<p>Some veterans and other McCain watchers have speculated that McCain\u2019s mortification, given his family\u2019s proud military tradition (his grandfather was also an admiral), was so severe that it continues to haunt him and make him fear any opening up of information that could revive previously unpublished details of the era, including his own nagging history.</p></blockquote>\n<p>McCain\u2019s nagging problem \u2013 at least while surviving Vietnam veterans and/or their family members were more prevalent than they are today \u2013 was the fact that there were actual witnesses to the evidence pointing toward the existence of American POWs in Vietnam.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vvof.org/mccain_hides.htm\">Schanburg writes</a> about the case of Dolores Apodaca Alfond, Chairwoman of the National Alliance of Families. He states,</p>\n<blockquote><p>Her pilot brother, Capt. Victor J. Apodaca, out of the Air Force Academy, was shot down over Dong Hoi, North Vietnam, in the early evening of June 8, 1967. At least one person in the two-man plane survived. Beeper signals from a pilot\u2019s distress radio were picked up by overhead helicopters, but the cloud cover was too heavy to go in.</p>\n<p>Hanoi has recently turned over some bone fragments that are supposed to be Apodaca\u2019s. The Pentagon first declared the fragments to be animal bones. But now it is telling the family \u2014 verbally \u2014 that they came from the pilot. But the Pentagon, for unexplained reasons, will not put this in writing, which means Apodaca is still unaccounted for. Also the Pentagon refuses to give Alfond a sample of the fragments so she can have testing done by an independent laboratory.</p>\n<p>Alfond\u2019s testimony, at a hearing of the POW/MIA committee Nov. 11, 1992, was revealing. She pleaded with the committee not to shut down in two months, as scheduled, because so much of its work was unfinished. Also, she was critical of the committee, and in particular Kerry and McCain, for having \u201cdiscredited the overhead satellite symbol pictures, arguing there is no way to be sure that the [distress] symbols were made by U.S. POWs.\u201d She also criticized them for similarly discounting data from special sensors, shaped like a large spike with an electronic pod and an antenna, that were airdropped to stick in the ground along the Ho Chi Minh trail.</p>\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n<p>Other than the panel\u2019s second co-chairman, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., not a single committee member attended this public hearing. But McCain, having been advised of Alfond\u2019s testimony, suddenly rushed into the room to confront her. His face angry and his voice very loud, he accused her of making \u201callegations \u2026 that are patently and totally false and deceptive.\u201d Making a fist, he shook his index finger at her and said she had insulted an emissary to Vietnam sent by President Bush. He said she had insulted other MIA families with her remarks. And then he said, through clenched teeth: \u201cAnd I am sick and tired of you insulting mine and other people\u2019s [patriotism] who happen to have different views than yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>By this time, tears were running down Alfond\u2019s cheeks. She reached into her handbag for a handkerchief. She tried to speak: \u201cThe family members have been waiting for years \u2014 years! And now you\u2019re shutting down.\u201d He kept interrupting her. She tried to say, through tears, that she had issued no insults. He kept talking over her words. He said she was accusing him and others of \u201csome conspiracy without proof, and some cover-up.\u201d She said she was merely seeking \u201csome answers. That is what I am asking.\u201d He ripped into her for using the word \u201cfiasco.\u201d She replied: \u201cThe fiasco was the people that stepped out and said we have written the end, the final chapter to Vietnam.\u201d \u201cNo one said that,\u201d he shouted. \u201cNo one said what you are saying they said, Ms. Alfond.\u201d And then, his face flaming pink, he stalked out of the room, to shouts of disfavor from members of the audience.</p>\n<p>As with most of McCain\u2019s remarks to Alfond, the facts in his closing blast at her were incorrect. Less than three weeks earlier, on Oct. 23, 1992, in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, President Bush \u2014 with John McCain standing beside him \u2014 said: \u201cToday, finally, I am convinced that we can begin writing the last chapter in the Vietnam War.\u201d</p>\n<p>The committee did indeed, as Alfond said they planned to do, shut down two months after the hearing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schanburg is no \u201cconspiracy theorist,\u201d it should be noted. He is a Pulitzer Prize winner from 1975 whose coverage of the social and political situation in Cambodia won him the award. Indeed, it was Schanburg\u2019s work that laid the basis for the movie <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Fields-The-Anniversary-Blu-ray/dp/B00F3LC93C?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=FGBNVPA47LBE2NTM&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_result_1\">The Killing Fields</a></em>.</p>\n<h2><strong>McCain\u2019s Support For ISIS</strong></h2>\n<p>Yet McCain\u2019s treachery regarding missing US military service personnel is not the only crime of his career by any stretch of the imagination. On the <em>Sean Hannity Show</em>, when responding to some tepid criticism by Rand Paul regarding the methods taken to support Western-backed jihadist death squads in Syria, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5-51-wLVG0\">McCain stated</a>,</p>\n<blockquote><p>Has Rand Paul ever been to Syria? Has he ever met with ISIS? Has he ever met with any of these people? No. No. We\u2019re gonna have a fight because it\u2019s patently false. This is the same Rand Paul that said we didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with anything by the way. I don\u2019t want to get in a fight with him at all. But it\u2019s not true. I know these people. I\u2019m in contact with them all the time and he is not.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Earlier in the interview, after stating that he could personally show Obama places on the map to bomb in Syria to kill ISIS, he also stated that, in regards to the death squads, \u201cI know these people intimately. We talk to them all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>McCain also referred back to the tired line of Syrian death squads actually being peaceful protesters \u201cfighting for freedom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Indeed, of those who provide material support to terrorism, John McCain would obviously rank at the top of the list. After all, John McCain led the charge in support of ISIS even before the terrorist group actually was called ISIS. Even after the new name and the brutality of its terrorist acts were revealed, John McCain has continued to push the outlandish lie that ISIS is a better choice than the secular government of Bashar al-Assad. He has also pushed for the U.S. Congress to support acting as Al-Qaeda\u2019s Air Force in Syria.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that even as the U.S. House was debating whether or not to pass token legislation to passively allow the Obama administration to perpetrate yet another foreign war against a sovereign nation that poses no threat to the United States, rabid warmonger John McCain was grilling Secretary of State John Kerry in what amounted to nothing more than some mildly entertaining D.C. theatre.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.politicususa.com/2014/09/17/john-mccain-dangerously-insists-full-scale-middle-east-war-isis-senate-hearing.html\">McCain grilled Kerry</a> on the reason why the United States is not engaging in airstrikes against Assad\u2019s air defenses as well as a full-scale ground invasion. Attempting to somehow paint Assad as worse than ISIS, McCain stated,</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think at least we owe the Free Syrian Army, negate the air attacks that they will be subjected to when they finish their training and equipping, and go into the fight. So why is it that we won\u2019t at least news release Bashar al Assad\u2019s air activity which has slaughtered thousands and thousands and thousands, 192,000 dead, 3 million refugees, and we\u2019re not going to do anything about Assad\u2019s air capabilities? And finally, ISIL first, that\u2019s what you\u2019re telling these young men who really view Assad as the one who has slaughtered their family members. Not ISIL. As bad as ISIL is.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yet while his ideology may not be a crime, actually meeting and coordinating with Al-Qaeda most certainly is. In this regard, McCain has overwhelmingly demonstrated his guilt, having been <a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2014/10/new-york-times-fail-mccain-no.html\">caught in a number of photographs</a> with the leader of death squad battalions, cannibals, and even the leader of al-Qaeda/ISIS himself.</p>\n<p>McCain\u2019s photo-op in Syria is a very interesting case since members of the general public are still considered as guilty of \u201cproviding material support\u201d to terrorists if they engage in the same activities.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Salem Idriss, one of the men seen in the photograph with John McCain, is the commander of the FSA, the \u201copposition group\u201d touted as a \u201cmoderate rebels.\u201d In reality, of course, the FSA is nothing of the sort. As Daniel Wagner wrote for the <em>Huffington Post</em> in December, 2012,</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the outskirts of Aleppo, the FSA has implemented a Sharia law enforcement police force that is a replica of the Wahhabi police in Saudi Arabia \u2014 forcing ordinary citizens to abide by the Sharia code. This is being done in a secular country which has never known Sharia Law. This type of action is currently also being implemented in northern Mali, where the West has officially declared its opposition to the al-Qaeda government that took control earlier this year. If what is happening near Aleppo is representative of what may happen if the FSA assumes control of Syria, the country may become an Islamic state. Is that really what the U.S. and other Western countries are intending to tacitly support?</p>\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n<p>The FSA has also been targeting the infrastructure of the country. One of the main power plants in Damascus was knocked out for three days last week, impacting 40 percent of the city\u2019s residents. Do \u2018freedom fighters\u2019 typically attack critical infrastructure that impacts ordinary citizens on a mass scale? The FSA long ago stopped targeting solely government and military targets.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The FSA is no stranger to atrocities. The FSA is the \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d that was filmed forcing a young child to behead a Syrian soldier. It is also the \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d that maintained <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-atrocities-committed-by-us-nato-sponsored-opposition-executioner-for-syria-s-rebels-tells-his-story/30072\">\u201cburial brigades,\u201d</a> a system of mass murder and mass executions against soldiers and those who support the Syrian government. The burial brigades were only <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2182572/Rebel-atrocities-Syria-rebels-true-colours-given-Assad-boost-propaganda-war.html\">one small part</a> of a much wider campaign of terror and executions implemented by the Free Syrian Army.</p>\n<p>Of course, the Free Syrian Army is merely the umbrella group of death squads carefully crafted to present a \u201cmoderate\u201d face on what is, in reality, nothing more than savage terrorists. Thus, the FSA encompasses(d) a number of smaller \u201cbrigades\u201d of al-Qaeda terrorists in order to cover up the true nature of its own ranks.</p>\n<p>One such brigade was the Farouq brigade, to which Abu Sakkar was a member. Sakkar, also seen in photographs with John McCain, was the famous rebel videotaped <a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2013/05/syrian-rebel-eats-soldiers-heart-paid.html\">cutting the heart out of a Syrian soldier and biting into it</a>.</p>\n<p>Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, another one of McCain\u2019s pic-mates, is now the leader of IS (ISIS/ISIL) and was the leader of al-Qaeda forces at the time that the photograph was taken. <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.voltairenet.org/article184211.html\">As <em>Voltaire Net</em> describes Baghdadi</a>,</p>\n<blockquote><p>Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is an Iraqi who joined Al-Qaeda to fight against President Saddam Hussein. During the U.S. invasion, he distinguished himself by engaging in several actions against Shiites and Christians (including the taking of the Baghdad Cathedral) and by ushering in an Islamist reign of terror (he presided over an Islamic court which sentenced many Iraqis to be slaughtered in public). After the departure of Paul Bremer III, al-Baghdadi was arrested and incarcerated at Camp Bucca from 2005 to 2009. This period saw the dissolution of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, whose fighters merged into a group of tribal resistance, the Islamic Emirate of Iraq.</p>\n<p>On 16 May 2010, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was named emir of the IEI, which was in the process of disintegration. After the departure of U.S. troops, he staged operations against the government al-Maliki, accused of being at the service of Iran. In 2013, after vowing allegiance to Al-Qaeda, he took off with his group to continue the jihad in Syria, rebaptizing it Islamic Emirate of Iraq and the Levant. In doing so, he challenged the privileges that Ayman al-Zawahiri had previously granted, on behalf of Al-Qaeda, to the Al-Nusra Front in Syria, which was originally nothing more than an extension of the ISI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Note that at no time was <a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2015/08/16/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-repeatedly-raped-american-hostage-kayla-mueller-officials-say/\" target=\"_blank\">Baghdadi</a> a \u201cmoderate rebel\u201d in any context. Nor was he ever anything more than <a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2014/08/10/shock-claim-egyptian-media-islamic-state-leader-al-baghdadi-jew-mossad-agent/\" target=\"_blank\">a puppet for Western intelligence agencies</a>.</p>\n<p>So McCain has met with at least three terrorists and terrorist organizations in Syria. But these groups are by no means the end of the trail of McCain\u2019s treachery or his connection to terrorism. After all, it must be remembered that McCain traveled to Libya during the assault against Ghaddafi in order to meet with terrorists in that country and promote the barbarism which they would ultimately bring. As Tony Cartalucci writes in his article, \u201c<a href=\"http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/09/john-mccain-claims-al-qaeda-thugs-have.html\">John McCain Claims Al-Qaeda Thugs Have \u2018Inspired The World</a>,\u2019\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/04/warmonger-mccain-in-benghazi.html\">He [McCain] had made an April visit to Benghazi</a>, a city cited along with neighboring Darnah <a href=\"http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/09/west-point-terror-center-confirms-al.html\">by a 2007 West Point report</a> as the terror recruiting capitals of the world and the primary sources of foreign fighters that made their way to Iraq fighting and killing American troops. These fighters did so under the flag of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), listed to this day by the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm\">US State Department as a \u201cforeign terrorist organization</a>.\u201d Despite overwhelming evidence and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8407047/Libyan-rebel-commander-admits-his-fighters-have-al-Qaeda-links.html\">even admissions from Libyan rebels themselves</a> of having ties to, being members of, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/04/world/la-fg-libya-islamists-20110904\">or in Tripoli \u201ccouncil leader\u201d Abdul Belhaj\u2019s case</a>, a leader of this listed terrorist organization, <a href=\"http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=7e95d18f-a9eb-80ef-e599-95754897384e&amp;Region_id=&amp;Issue_id=1bd7f3a7-a52b-4ad0-a338-646c6a780d65\">McCain would declare</a> he had \u201cmet with these brave fighters, and they are not Al-Qaeda. To the contrary: They are Libyan patriots who want to liberate their nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite McCain\u2019s reassuring words, the rebels over the next several months would increasingly reveal their true nature to a horrified world as they waged racist genocide against Libya\u2019s darker and black tribes, and conducted their \u201cliberation\u201d against cities resisting them with indiscriminate heavy weapons, blockades designed to literally <a href=\"http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/09/libya-rebels-create-humanitarian.html\">starve the populations into submission</a> and horrific reprisals once cities fell. While the corporate media did its best to obfuscate these atrocities, when entire cities like Tawarga with its 10,000 residents began disappearing from the map, even the propagandists were forced to acknowledge the \u201cliberators\u201d were less than noble.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It should also be noted that McCain is extremely close to the <a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2014/04/the-history-and-science-of-color.html\">color revolution</a> apparatus organization, the International Republican Institute, a wing of the National Endowment for Democracy and USAID. In fact, he is the current <a href=\"http://www.iri.org/learn-more-about-iri/board-directors-and-officers\">Chairman of the IRI</a>.</p>\n<p>As it currently stands, the fact that some people are more equal than others is clearly proven in the case of John McCain. While any other American would be immediately imprisoned and possibly tortured as a result of their connections to terrorism, John McCain is rewarded with the title of U.S. Senator and the false label of \u201cwar hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is thus important for every American to know that not only is there no such thing as a moderate opposition in Syria but that John McCain is no American hero. If the Americans mentioned in the recent AP report can be investigated, tried, and convicted of providing support for terrorists operating abroad then surely John McCain has earned his day in court.</p>\n<h2><strong>McCain And The Nazis</strong></h2>\n<p>Yet another stop on his world tour of destabilization and incitement to war crimes was Kiev, where McCain was <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/john-mccain-meets-oleh-tyahnybok-in-ukraine-2013-12\">photographed standing next to neo-Nazi Oleh Tyahnybok</a>, the leader of the nationalist and neo-nazi Svoboda party.</p>\n<p>As Tony Cartalucci reported in his article \u201c<a href=\"http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2014/01/a-tale-of-two-protests-ukraine-and.html\">US Sponsored Democracy: A Tale of Two Protests. Ukraine and Thailand</a>,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>Along with other racist, bigoted, extremist political parties including \u201cFatherland,\u201d Svoboda has filled the streets, clashed with police, occupied government buildings and called for the overthrow of the elected government of Ukraine \u2013 for the sake of joining the European Union. The EU, for its part, awaits these mobs with open arms.</p>\n<p>Joining the EU in anticipation is US Senator John McCain of the US National Endowment for Democracy\u2019s (NED) <a href=\"http://www.iri.org/learn-more-about-iri/board-directors-and-officers\">International Republican Institute</a>. McCain went as far as traveling to Kiev, Ukraine, and even taking to the stage at the protest \u2013 side-by-side with Svoboda leader Oleh Tyahnybok.</p>\n<p>Of Svoboda, the Business Insider would have this to say in their article titled, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/john-mccain-meets-oleh-tyahnybok-in-ukraine-2013-12\">John McCain Went To Ukraine And Stood On Stage With A Man Accused Of Being An Anti-Semitic Neo-Nazi</a>:\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026Svoboda (which means freedom in Ukrainian) is one of those reconstructed modern European far right parties \u2014 it is aligned with the British National Party and the French National Front, for example \u2014 and it has gained some kind of electoral legitimacy, winning 10 percent of the seats in Ukraine\u2019s parliament in 2010.</p>\n<p>However, the party\u2019s past is seriously murky. When it was founded in 1995, the party called itself the Social-National Party of Ukraine (SNPU), and it had a swastika-like logo. While it eventually split from its more right wing members, the party remained focused on celebrating Ukrainian ethnic identity in opposition to Russia and Communism.</p>\n<p>Tyahnybok himself was expelled from the Our Ukraine parliamentary faction in 2004 after giving a speech demanding that Ukrainians fight against a \u201dMuscovite-Jewish mafia\u201d (he later clarified this by saying that he actually had Jewish friends and was only against to \u201ca group of Jewish oligarchs who control Ukraine and against Jewish-Bolsheviks [in the past]\u201c). In 2005 he wrote open letters demanding Ukraine do more to halt \u201ccriminal activities\u201d of \u201corganized Jewry,\u201d and, even now, Svoboda openly calls for Ukrainian citizens to have their ethnicity printed onto their passports.</p>\n<p>One could scarcely imagine what justification John McCain could give for associating with literal Nazis. But one will have to be satisfied with only imagining, since the Western media, charged with seeking the truth, has not raised this question let alone answered it. Even the Business Insider attempts to give McCain the benefit of the doubt in order to allow the protests to continue and to allow the US, UK, and EU to continue openly supporting them.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>The fact that John McCain is represented as an expert or, even worse, a hero by any mainstream media outlet is a slap in the face to all basic common sense. The facts surrounding this man show him placing American service men and women in harm\u2019s way on almost innumerable occasions while simultaneously working to stab them in the back by ensuring that those who are missing in action are forgotten or even working closely with the individuals and organizations who are supposedly the enemy of the United States.</p>\n<p>This is of no concern to McCain of course, who, <a href=\"http://www.phibetaiota.net/2013/06/henry-kissinger-military-men-are-dumb-stupid-animals-to-be-used-as-pawns-for-foreign-policy/\">like his friend Henry Kissinger</a>, believes that military personnel are just \u201cdumb stupid animals to be used for foreign policy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obviously, GI John is no American hero.</p>\n<p><em>Brandon Turbeville \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/tag/brandon-turbeville\">article archive here</a> \u2013 is an author out of Florence, South Carolina.

No Criticism From MSM", "url": "http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/02/24/john-mccain-illegally-travels-to-syria-meets-with-leaders-and-fighting-groups-no-criticism-from-msm/", "date": "02-24-2017", "source": "dcclothesline", "text": "Shortly after the mainstream media erupted in hysteria and neo-McCarthyistic attacks against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn for having a routine conversation with the Russian Ambassador and for once having dinner with the President of Russia as part of an event, aging warmonger Senator John McCain recently announced that he had traveled illegally into Syria to meet with U.S. troops illegally stationed there as well as to meet with ISIS supporter and President of Turkey, Recep Tayip Erdogan. McCain also met with the Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and crown prince Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. In addition, McCain also met with Kurdish fighters on the ground in Syria.\n\nOn February 22, McCain\u2019s spokeswoman, Julie Tarallo, confirmed that McCain had made the trip, saying it was a \u201cvaluable opportunity to assess dynamic conditions on the ground in Syria and Iraq.\u201d\n\nTarallo also praised Trump\u2019s order to require the Department of Defense to provide a plan for combating the Islamic State in Syria within thirty days. She said, \u201cSenator McCain looks forward to working with the administration and military leaders to optimize our approach for accomplishing ISIL\u2019s lasting defeat.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the trip was organized with the help of the U.S. military.\n\nCuriously, (or, rather, typically), there were no catcalls of suspicion from the mainstream press nor were there suggestions that McCain had violated the Logan Act, even though he admitted he discussed the possibility of establishing \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria and \u201cstrategies\u201d for \u201cfighting ISIS\u201d in Syria with both Erdogan and international relations with the Saudi King and UAE crown prince.\n\nMcCain was also present at the Munich Security Conference where he criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric regarding NATO and his lack of adequate warmongering during the first two months of his presidency. According to the Associated Press,\n\nDuring a speech Friday at the Munich Security Conference, McCain delivered a withering critique of Trump\u2019s worldview as he lamented a shift in the U.S. and Europe away from the \u2018universal values\u2019 that forged the Western alliance 70 years ago. McCain on Monday welcomed Trump\u2019s selection of Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster to be his national security adviser, calling the pick an \u201coutstanding choice.\u201d\n\nBack in 2013, McCain traveled to Syria illegally where he met with terrorists backed by the United States and NATO, even taking pictures with terrorist leaders and some of the most bloodthirsty commanders of the invasion. McCain received virtually no criticism for his open violation of various American laws (including the ones he voted for). However, when U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard and former Rep. Dennis Kucinich met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after having traveled to Syria in order to tour the country and see the realities of the destruction the war, both were ravaged in the press.\n\nMcCain has had a long history of engaging in behavior that would have long ago torpedoed the career of many politicians and resulted in the incarceration of any average American. Remarkably, however, it doesn\u2019t appear that age has slowed him down at all.\n\nMcCain Dismisses Missing Military Personnel\n\nAs Schanburg writes,As Sydney Schanburg wrote in his excellent article, \u201cThe War Secrets Sen. John McCain Hides,\u201d McCain was consistent, at least in his actions, in his refusal to allow any further attempts to discover and recover missing American POWs in Vietnam as well as even the possibility of allowing any further investigation as to the possibility that Americans were still being held captive. This is, of course, despite McCain\u2019s incessant reliance on his military service as some type of qualification for whatever his political position of the day might be.\n\nBut there was one subject that was off-limits, a subject the Arizona senator almost never brings up and has never been open about \u2014 his long-time opposition to releasing documents and information about American prisoners of war in Vietnam and the missing in action who have still not been accounted for. Since McCain himself, a downed Navy pilot, was a prisoner in Hanoi for 5 1/2 years, his staunch resistance to laying open the POW/MIA records has baffled colleagues and others who have followed his career. Critics say his anti-disclosure campaign, in close cooperation with the Pentagon and the intelligence community, has been successful. Literally thousands of documents that would otherwise have been declassified long ago have been legislated into secrecy. For example, all the Pentagon debriefings of the prisoners who returned from Vietnam are now classified and closed to the public under a statute enacted in the 1990s with McCain\u2019s backing. He says this is to protect the privacy of former POWs and gives it as his reason for not making public his own debriefing. [\u2026] Many Vietnam veterans and former POWs have fumed at McCain for keeping these and other wartime files sealed up. His explanation, offered freely in Senate hearings and floor speeches, is that no one has been proven still alive and that releasing the files would revive painful memories and cause needless emotional stress to former prisoners, their families and the families of MIAs still unaccounted for. But what if some of these returned prisoners, as has always been the case at the conclusion of wars, reveal information to their debriefing officers about other prisoners believed still held in captivity? What justification is there for filtering such information through the Pentagon rather than allowing access to source materials? For instance, debriefings from returning Korean war POWs, available in full to the American public, have provided both citizens and government investigators with important information about other Americans who went missing in that conflict. Would not most families of missing men, no matter how emotionally drained, want to know? And would they not also want to know what the government was doing to rescue their husbands and sons? Hundreds of MIA families have for years been questioning if concern for their feelings is the real reason for the secrecy.\n\nOthers, however, suspect that all of McCain\u2019s insistence in keeping the information classified revolves around whether or not releasing the debriefings would open the door to McCain\u2019s closet, suggesting that there skeletons lurking inside it that the Senator does not want falling out. Schanburg writes,\n\nA smaller number of former POWs, MIA families and veterans have suggested there is something especially damning about McCain that the senator wants to keep hidden. Without release of the files, such accusations must be viewed as unsubstantiated speculation. The main reason, however, for seeking these files is to find out if there is any information in the debriefings, or in other MIA documents that McCain and the Pentagon have kept sealed, about how many prisoners were held back by North Vietnam after the Paris peace treaty was signed in January 1973. The defense and intelligence establishment has long resisted the declassification of critical records on this subject. McCain has been the main congressional force behind this effort. The prisoner return in 1973 saw 591 Americans repatriated by North Vietnam. The problem was that the U.S. intelligence list of men believed to be alive at that time in captivity \u2014 in Vietnam, Laos and possibly across the border in southern China and in the Soviet Union \u2014 was much larger. Possibly hundreds of men larger. The State Department stated publicly in 1973 that intelligence data showed the prisoner list to be starkly incomplete. For example, only nine of the 591 returnees came out of Laos, though experts in U.S. military intelligence listed 311 men as missing in that Hanoi-run country alone, and their field reports indicated that many of those men were probably still alive. Hanoi said it was returning all the prisoners it had. President Nixon, on March 29, 1973, seconded that claim, telling the nation on television: \u201cAll of our American POWs are on their way home.\u201d This discrepancy has never been acknowledged or explained by official Washington. Over the years in Washington, McCain, at times almost single-handedly, has pushed through Pentagon-desired legislation to make it impossible or much harder for the public to acquire POW/MIA information and much easier for the defense bureaucracy to keep it hidden.\n\nThen there is also the case of the Truth Bill. A relatively simple bill which stated that\n\n[The] head of each department or agency which holds or receives any records and information, including live-sighting reports, which have been correlated or possibly correlated to United States personnel listed as prisoner of war or missing in action from World War II, the Korean conflict and the Vietnam conflict shall make available to the public all such records and information held or received by that department or agency. In addition, the Department of Defense shall make available to the public with its records and information a complete listing of United States personnel classified as prisoner of war, missing in action, or killed in action (body not returned) from World War II, the Korean conflict, and the Vietnam conflict.\n\nAs one might suspect, a Pentagon implicated in the abandonment of these soldiers thus vehemently opposed the bill.\n\nThe bill was defeated in 1989. In 1991, it reappeared only to quickly disappear again. Although the interest from family members of the missing veterans as well as the American public had not necessarily waned, another bill was inserted in its place \u2013 The McCain Bill. As Schanburg describes,\n\nThis measure turned \u201cThe Truth Bill \u201d on its head. It created a bureaucratic maze from which only a fraction of the available documents could emerge. And it became law. So restrictive were its provisions that one clause actually said the Pentagon didn\u2019t even have to inform the public when it received intelligence that Americans were alive in captivity. First, it decreed that only three categories of information could be released, i.e., \u201cinformation \u2026 that may pertain to the location, treatment, or condition of\u201d unaccounted-for personnel from the Vietnam War. (This was later amended in 1995 and 1996 to include the Cold War and the Korean conflict.) If information is received about anything other than \u201clocation, treatment or condition,\u201d under this statute, which was enacted in December 1991, it does not get disclosed. Second, before such information can be released to the public, permission must be granted by the primary next of kin, or PNOK. In the case of Vietnam, letters were sent by the Department of Defense to the 2,266 PNOK. More than 600 declined consent (including 243 who failed to respond, considered under the law to be a \u201cno\u201d). [\u2026] Finally, in addition to these hurdles and limitations, the McCain act does not specifically order the declassification of the information. Further, it provides the Defense Department with other justifications for withholding documents. One such clause says that if the information \u201cmay compromise the safety of any United States personnel \u2026 who remain not accounted for but who may still be alive in captivity, then the Secretary [of Defense] may withhold that record or other information from the disclosure otherwise required by this section.\u201d Boiled down, the preceding paragraph means that the Defense Department is not obligated to tell the public about prisoners believed alive in captivity and what efforts are being made to rescue them. It only has to notify the White House and the intelligence committees in the Senate and House. The committees are forbidden under law from releasing such information. At the same time, the McCain act is now being used to deny access to other sorts of records. For instance, part of a recent APBnews.com Freedom of Information Act request for the records of a mutiny on merchant marine vessel in the 1970s was rejected by a Defense Department official who cited the McCain act. Similarly, requests for information about Americans missing in the Korean War and declared dead for the last 45 years have been denied by officials who reference the McCain statute. In 1996, however, another bill appeared. Entitled the Missing Service Personnel Act, the bill attempted to force the Pentagon to do more and act faster to find and subsequently recover missing military service personnel. The bill contained measures that required very strict reporting requirements for these purposes.\n\nSchanburg describes how McCain once again rode into town to destroy any potential that may have existed to discover existing missing personnel or any personnel who might become missing in the future. He writes,\n\nMcCain amended the heart out of the statute. For example, the 1995 version required a unit commander to report to his theater commander within two days that a person was missing and describe what rescue and recovery efforts were underway. The McCain amendments allowed 10 days to pass before a report had to be made. In the 1995 act, the theater commander, after receiving the MIA report, would have 14 days to report to his Cabinet secretary in Washington. His report had to \u201ccertify\u201d that all necessary actions were being taken and all appropriate assets were being used \u201cto resolve the status of the missing person.\u201d This section was stricken from the act, replaced with language that made the Cabinet secretary, not the theater commander, the recipient of the report from the field. All the certification requirements also were stricken. [\u2026] In response, the backers of the original statute cited the Pentagon\u2019s stained record on MIA\u2019s and argued that military history had shown that speed of action is critical to the chances of recovering a missing man. Moving \u201cthe bureaucracy \u201d to Washington, they said, was merely a way to sweep the issue under a rug.\n\nOne final evisceration in the law was McCain\u2019s removal of all its enforcement teeth. The original act provided for criminal penalties for anyone, such as military bureaucrats in Washington, who destroy or cover up or withhold from families any information about a missing man. McCain erased this part of the law. He said the penalties would have a chilling effect on the Pentagon\u2019s ability to recruit personnel for its POW/MIA office.\n\nSchanburg points out how McCain has personally acted as the first line of defense against any who may suggest that POWs were left to their fate in Vietnam. McCain acts, on this issue especially, behind a carefully crafted but false veneer of patriotism and military service that appears to make him infallible in the eyes of many low information voters.\n\nSchanburg writes,\n\nMcCain does not deal lightly with those who disagree with him on any of these issues or who suggest that the evidence indeed shows that a significant number of prisoners were alive and cached away as future bargaining chips when he came home in the group of 591 released in 1973. Over the years, he has regularly vilified any group or person who keeps trying to pry out more evidence about MIAs. He calls them \u201choaxers\u201d and \u201ccharlatans \u201d and \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d He decries the \u201cbizarre rantings of the MIA hobbyists\u201d and describes them as \u201cindividuals primarily who make their living off of keeping the issue alive.\u201d Before he died last year of leukemia, retired Col. Ted Guy, a highly admired POW and one of the most dogged resisters in the camps, wrote an angry open letter to the senator in an MIA newsletter. In it, he said of McCain\u2019s stream of insults: \u201cJohn, does this include Senator Bob Smith and other concerned elected officials? Does this include the families of the missing where there is overwhelming evidence that their loved ones were \u2018last known alive? \u2019 Does this include some of your fellow POWs?\u201d Clearly, McCain likes dissent the way he likes his veterans \u2013 silent. This silence, for McCain, can come by any means necessary.\n\nIndeed, McCain has been the biggest denier of all when it comes to the possibility that American soldiers were left on the battlefield. Schanburg states,\n\nMcCain has said again and again that he has seen no \u201ccredible\u201d evidence that more than a tiny handful of men might have been alive in captivity after the official prison return in 1973. He dismisses all of the subsequent radio intercepts, live sightings, satellite photos, CIA reports, defector information, recovered enemy documents and reports of ransom demands \u2014 thousands and thousands of pieces of information indicating live captives \u2014 as meaningless. He has even described these intelligence reports as the rough equivalent of UFO and alien sightings. In Congress, colleagues and staffers who have seen him erupt \u2014 in the open and, more often, in closed meetings \u2014 profess themselves confounded by his behavior. Insisting upon anonymity so as not to invite one of his verbal assaults, they say they have no easy way to explain why a former POW would work so hard and so persistently to keep POW/MIA information from coming out. Typical is the comment of one congressional veteran who has watched McCain over many years: \u201cThis is a man not at peace with himself.\u201d Some McCain watchers searching for answers point to his recently published best-selling autobiography, Faith of My Fathers, half of which is devoted to his years as a prisoner. In the book, he says he felt badly throughout his captivity because he knew he was being treated more leniently than his fellow POWs owing to his propaganda value as the son of Adm. John S. McCain II, who was then the CINCPAC \u2014 commander in chief of all U.S. forces in the Pacific region, including Vietnam. (His captors considered him a prize catch and nicknamed him the \u201cCrown Prince.\u201d) Also in the book, the Arizona Senator repeatedly expresses guilt and disgrace at having broken under torture and given the North Vietnamese a taped confession, broadcast over the camp loudspeakers, saying he was a war criminal who had, among other acts, bombed a school. \u201cI felt faithless and couldn\u2019t control my despair,\u201d he writes. He writes, revealing that he made two half-hearted attempts at suicide. Most tellingly, he said he lived in \u201cdread\u201d that his father would find out. \u201cI still wince,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I recall wondering if my father had heard of my disgrace.\u201d [\u2026] But how would McCain\u2019s forced confession alone explain his endless campaign against releasing MIA/POW information? Some veterans and other McCain watchers have speculated that McCain\u2019s mortification, given his family\u2019s proud military tradition (his grandfather was also an admiral), was so severe that it continues to haunt him and make him fear any opening up of information that could revive previously unpublished details of the era, including his own nagging history.\n\nMcCain\u2019s nagging problem \u2013 at least while surviving Vietnam veterans and/or their family members were more prevalent than they are today \u2013 was the fact that there were actual witnesses to the evidence pointing toward the existence of American POWs in Vietnam.\n\nSchanburg writes about the case of Dolores Apodaca Alfond, Chairwoman of the National Alliance of Families. He states,\n\nHer pilot brother, Capt. Victor J. Apodaca, out of the Air Force Academy, was shot down over Dong Hoi, North Vietnam, in the early evening of June 8, 1967. At least one person in the two-man plane survived. Beeper signals from a pilot\u2019s distress radio were picked up by overhead helicopters, but the cloud cover was too heavy to go in. Hanoi has recently turned over some bone fragments that are supposed to be Apodaca\u2019s. The Pentagon first declared the fragments to be animal bones. But now it is telling the family \u2014 verbally \u2014 that they came from the pilot. But the Pentagon, for unexplained reasons, will not put this in writing, which means Apodaca is still unaccounted for. Also the Pentagon refuses to give Alfond a sample of the fragments so she can have testing done by an independent laboratory. Alfond\u2019s testimony, at a hearing of the POW/MIA committee Nov. 11, 1992, was revealing. She pleaded with the committee not to shut down in two months, as scheduled, because so much of its work was unfinished. Also, she was critical of the committee, and in particular Kerry and McCain, for having \u201cdiscredited the overhead satellite symbol pictures, arguing there is no way to be sure that the [distress] symbols were made by U.S. POWs.\u201d She also criticized them for similarly discounting data from special sensors, shaped like a large spike with an electronic pod and an antenna, that were airdropped to stick in the ground along the Ho Chi Minh trail. [\u2026] Other than the panel\u2019s second co-chairman, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., not a single committee member attended this public hearing. But McCain, having been advised of Alfond\u2019s testimony, suddenly rushed into the room to confront her. His face angry and his voice very loud, he accused her of making \u201callegations \u2026 that are patently and totally false and deceptive.\u201d Making a fist, he shook his index finger at her and said she had insulted an emissary to Vietnam sent by President Bush. He said she had insulted other MIA families with her remarks. And then he said, through clenched teeth: \u201cAnd I am sick and tired of you insulting mine and other people\u2019s [patriotism] who happen to have different views than yours.\u201d By this time, tears were running down Alfond\u2019s cheeks. She reached into her handbag for a handkerchief. She tried to speak: \u201cThe family members have been waiting for years \u2014 years! And now you\u2019re shutting down.\u201d He kept interrupting her. She tried to say, through tears, that she had issued no insults. He kept talking over her words. He said she was accusing him and others of \u201csome conspiracy without proof, and some cover-up.\u201d She said she was merely seeking \u201csome answers. That is what I am asking.\u201d He ripped into her for using the word \u201cfiasco.\u201d She replied: \u201cThe fiasco was the people that stepped out and said we have written the end, the final chapter to Vietnam.\u201d \u201cNo one said that,\u201d he shouted. \u201cNo one said what you are saying they said, Ms. Alfond.\u201d And then, his face flaming pink, he stalked out of the room, to shouts of disfavor from members of the audience. As with most of McCain\u2019s remarks to Alfond, the facts in his closing blast at her were incorrect. Less than three weeks earlier, on Oct. 23, 1992, in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, President Bush \u2014 with John McCain standing beside him \u2014 said: \u201cToday, finally, I am convinced that we can begin writing the last chapter in the Vietnam War.\u201d The committee did indeed, as Alfond said they planned to do, shut down two months after the hearing.\n\nSchanburg is no \u201cconspiracy theorist,\u201d it should be noted. He is a Pulitzer Prize winner from 1975 whose coverage of the social and political situation in Cambodia won him the award. Indeed, it was Schanburg\u2019s work that laid the basis for the movie The Killing Fields.\n\nMcCain\u2019s Support For ISIS\n\nYet McCain\u2019s treachery regarding missing US military service personnel is not the only crime of his career by any stretch of the imagination. On the Sean Hannity Show, when responding to some tepid criticism by Rand Paul regarding the methods taken to support Western-backed jihadist death squads in Syria, McCain stated,\n\nHas Rand Paul ever been to Syria? Has he ever met with ISIS? Has he ever met with any of these people? No. No. We\u2019re gonna have a fight because it\u2019s patently false. This is the same Rand Paul that said we didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with anything by the way. I don\u2019t want to get in a fight with him at all. But it\u2019s not true. I know these people. I\u2019m in contact with them all the time and he is not.\n\nEarlier in the interview, after stating that he could personally show Obama places on the map to bomb in Syria to kill ISIS, he also stated that, in regards to the death squads, \u201cI know these people intimately. We talk to them all the time.\u201d\n\nMcCain also referred back to the tired line of Syrian death squads actually being peaceful protesters \u201cfighting for freedom.\u201d\n\nIndeed, of those who provide material support to terrorism, John McCain would obviously rank at the top of the list. After all, John McCain led the charge in support of ISIS even before the terrorist group actually was called ISIS. Even after the new name and the brutality of its terrorist acts were revealed, John McCain has continued to push the outlandish lie that ISIS is a better choice than the secular government of Bashar al-Assad. He has also pushed for the U.S. Congress to support acting as Al-Qaeda\u2019s Air Force in Syria.\n\nIt is important to note that even as the U.S. House was debating whether or not to pass token legislation to passively allow the Obama administration to perpetrate yet another foreign war against a sovereign nation that poses no threat to the United States, rabid warmonger John McCain was grilling Secretary of State John Kerry in what amounted to nothing more than some mildly entertaining D.C. theatre.\n\nMcCain grilled Kerry on the reason why the United States is not engaging in airstrikes against Assad\u2019s air defenses as well as a full-scale ground invasion. Attempting to somehow paint Assad as worse than ISIS, McCain stated,\n\nI think at least we owe the Free Syrian Army, negate the air attacks that they will be subjected to when they finish their training and equipping, and go into the fight. So why is it that we won\u2019t at least news release Bashar al Assad\u2019s air activity which has slaughtered thousands and thousands and thousands, 192,000 dead, 3 million refugees, and we\u2019re not going to do anything about Assad\u2019s air capabilities? And finally, ISIL first, that\u2019s what you\u2019re telling these young men who really view Assad as the one who has slaughtered their family members. Not ISIL. As bad as ISIL is.\n\nYet while his ideology may not be a crime, actually meeting and coordinating with Al-Qaeda most certainly is. In this regard, McCain has overwhelmingly demonstrated his guilt, having been caught in a number of photographs with the leader of death squad battalions, cannibals, and even the leader of al-Qaeda/ISIS himself.\n\nMcCain\u2019s photo-op in Syria is a very interesting case since members of the general public are still considered as guilty of \u201cproviding material support\u201d to terrorists if they engage in the same activities.\n\nRegardless, Salem Idriss, one of the men seen in the photograph with John McCain, is the commander of the FSA, the \u201copposition group\u201d touted as a \u201cmoderate rebels.\u201d In reality, of course, the FSA is nothing of the sort. As Daniel Wagner wrote for the Huffington Post in December, 2012,\n\nIn the outskirts of Aleppo, the FSA has implemented a Sharia law enforcement police force that is a replica of the Wahhabi police in Saudi Arabia \u2014 forcing ordinary citizens to abide by the Sharia code. This is being done in a secular country which has never known Sharia Law. This type of action is currently also being implemented in northern Mali, where the West has officially declared its opposition to the al-Qaeda government that took control earlier this year. If what is happening near Aleppo is representative of what may happen if the FSA assumes control of Syria, the country may become an Islamic state. Is that really what the U.S. and other Western countries are intending to tacitly support? [\u2026] The FSA has also been targeting the infrastructure of the country. One of the main power plants in Damascus was knocked out for three days last week, impacting 40 percent of the city\u2019s residents. Do \u2018freedom fighters\u2019 typically attack critical infrastructure that impacts ordinary citizens on a mass scale? The FSA long ago stopped targeting solely government and military targets.\n\nThe FSA is no stranger to atrocities. The FSA is the \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d that was filmed forcing a young child to behead a Syrian soldier. It is also the \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d that maintained \u201cburial brigades,\u201d a system of mass murder and mass executions against soldiers and those who support the Syrian government. The burial brigades were only one small part of a much wider campaign of terror and executions implemented by the Free Syrian Army.\n\nOf course, the Free Syrian Army is merely the umbrella group of death squads carefully crafted to present a \u201cmoderate\u201d face on what is, in reality, nothing more than savage terrorists. Thus, the FSA encompasses(d) a number of smaller \u201cbrigades\u201d of al-Qaeda terrorists in order to cover up the true nature of its own ranks.\n\nOne such brigade was the Farouq brigade, to which Abu Sakkar was a member. Sakkar, also seen in photographs with John McCain, was the famous rebel videotaped cutting the heart out of a Syrian soldier and biting into it.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, another one of McCain\u2019s pic-mates, is now the leader of IS (ISIS/ISIL) and was the leader of al-Qaeda forces at the time that the photograph was taken. As Voltaire Net describes Baghdadi,\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi is an Iraqi who joined Al-Qaeda to fight against President Saddam Hussein. During the U.S. invasion, he distinguished himself by engaging in several actions against Shiites and Christians (including the taking of the Baghdad Cathedral) and by ushering in an Islamist reign of terror (he presided over an Islamic court which sentenced many Iraqis to be slaughtered in public). After the departure of Paul Bremer III, al-Baghdadi was arrested and incarcerated at Camp Bucca from 2005 to 2009. This period saw the dissolution of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, whose fighters merged into a group of tribal resistance, the Islamic Emirate of Iraq. On 16 May 2010, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was named emir of the IEI, which was in the process of disintegration. After the departure of U.S. troops, he staged operations against the government al-Maliki, accused of being at the service of Iran. In 2013, after vowing allegiance to Al-Qaeda, he took off with his group to continue the jihad in Syria, rebaptizing it Islamic Emirate of Iraq and the Levant. In doing so, he challenged the privileges that Ayman al-Zawahiri had previously granted, on behalf of Al-Qaeda, to the Al-Nusra Front in Syria, which was originally nothing more than an extension of the ISI.\n\nNote that at no time was Baghdadi a \u201cmoderate rebel\u201d in any context. Nor was he ever anything more than a puppet for Western intelligence agencies.\n\nSo McCain has met with at least three terrorists and terrorist organizations in Syria. But these groups are by no means the end of the trail of McCain\u2019s treachery or his connection to terrorism. After all, it must be remembered that McCain traveled to Libya during the assault against Ghaddafi in order to meet with terrorists in that country and promote the barbarism which they would ultimately bring. As Tony Cartalucci writes in his article, \u201cJohn McCain Claims Al-Qaeda Thugs Have \u2018Inspired The World,\u2019\u201d\n\nIt should also be noted that McCain is extremely close to the color revolution apparatus organization, the International Republican Institute, a wing of the National Endowment for Democracy and USAID. In fact, he is the current Chairman of the IRI.\n\nAs it currently stands, the fact that some people are more equal than others is clearly proven in the case of John McCain. While any other American would be immediately imprisoned and possibly tortured as a result of their connections to terrorism, John McCain is rewarded with the title of U.S. Senator and the false label of \u201cwar hero.\u201d\n\nIt is thus important for every American to know that not only is there no such thing as a moderate opposition in Syria but that John McCain is no American hero. If the Americans mentioned in the recent AP report can be investigated, tried, and convicted of providing support for terrorists operating abroad then surely John McCain has earned his day in court.\n\nMcCain And The Nazis\n\nYet another stop on his world tour of destabilization and incitement to war crimes was Kiev, where McCain was photographed standing next to neo-Nazi Oleh Tyahnybok, the leader of the nationalist and neo-nazi Svoboda party.\n\nAs Tony Cartalucci reported in his article \u201cUS Sponsored Democracy: A Tale of Two Protests. Ukraine and Thailand,\u201d\n\nAlong with other racist, bigoted, extremist political parties including \u201cFatherland,\u201d Svoboda has filled the streets, clashed with police, occupied government buildings and called for the overthrow of the elected government of Ukraine \u2013 for the sake of joining the European Union. The EU, for its part, awaits these mobs with open arms. Joining the EU in anticipation is US Senator John McCain of the US National Endowment for Democracy\u2019s (NED) International Republican Institute. McCain went as far as traveling to Kiev, Ukraine, and even taking to the stage at the protest \u2013 side-by-side with Svoboda leader Oleh Tyahnybok. Of Svoboda, the Business Insider would have this to say in their article titled, \u201cJohn McCain Went To Ukraine And Stood On Stage With A Man Accused Of Being An Anti-Semitic Neo-Nazi:\u201d \u2026Svoboda (which means freedom in Ukrainian) is one of those reconstructed modern European far right parties \u2014 it is aligned with the British National Party and the French National Front, for example \u2014 and it has gained some kind of electoral legitimacy, winning 10 percent of the seats in Ukraine\u2019s parliament in 2010. However, the party\u2019s past is seriously murky. When it was founded in 1995, the party called itself the Social-National Party of Ukraine (SNPU), and it had a swastika-like logo. While it eventually split from its more right wing members, the party remained focused on celebrating Ukrainian ethnic identity in opposition to Russia and Communism. Tyahnybok himself was expelled from the Our Ukraine parliamentary faction in 2004 after giving a speech demanding that Ukrainians fight against a \u201dMuscovite-Jewish mafia\u201d (he later clarified this by saying that he actually had Jewish friends and was only against to \u201ca group of Jewish oligarchs who control Ukraine and against Jewish-Bolsheviks [in the past]\u201c). In 2005 he wrote open letters demanding Ukraine do more to halt \u201ccriminal activities\u201d of \u201corganized Jewry,\u201d and, even now, Svoboda openly calls for Ukrainian citizens to have their ethnicity printed onto their passports. One could scarcely imagine what justification John McCain could give for associating with literal Nazis. But one will have to be satisfied with only imagining, since the Western media, charged with seeking the truth, has not raised this question let alone answered it. Even the Business Insider attempts to give McCain the benefit of the doubt in order to allow the protests to continue and to allow the US, UK, and EU to continue openly supporting them.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe fact that John McCain is represented as an expert or, even worse, a hero by any mainstream media outlet is a slap in the face to all basic common sense. The facts surrounding this man show him placing American service men and women in harm\u2019s way on almost innumerable occasions while simultaneously working to stab them in the back by ensuring that those who are missing in action are forgotten or even working closely with the individuals and organizations who are supposedly the enemy of the United States.\n\nThis is of no concern to McCain of course, who, like his friend Henry Kissinger, believes that military personnel are just \u201cdumb stupid animals to be used for foreign policy.\u201d\n\nObviously, GI John is no American hero.\n\nBrandon Turbeville \u2013 article archive here \u2013 is an author out of Florence, South Carolina.
