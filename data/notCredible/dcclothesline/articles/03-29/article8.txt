It wants to rule.</p>\n<p>Daniel Greenfield \u2022 March 27, 2017 \u2022 <em>Frontpage Mag</em></p>\n<p>A civil war has begun.</p>\n<p>This civil war is very different than the last one. There are no cannons or cavalry charges. The left doesn\u2019t want to secede. It wants to rule. Political conflicts become civil wars when one side refuses to accept the existing authority. The left has rejected all forms of authority that it doesn\u2019t control.</p>\n<p>The left has rejected the outcome of the last two presidential elections won by Republicans. It has rejected the judicial authority of the Supreme Court when its decisions don\u2019t accord with its agenda. It rejects the legislative authority of Congress when it is not dominated by the left.</p>\n<p>It rejected the Constitution so long ago that it hardly bears mentioning.</p>\n<p>It was for total unilateral executive authority under Obama. And now it\u2019s for states unilaterally deciding what laws they will follow. (As long as that involves defying immigration laws under Trump, not following them under Obama.) It was for the sacrosanct authority of the Senate when it held the majority. Then it decried the Senate as an outmoded institution when the Republicans took it over.</p>\n<p>It was for Obama defying the orders of Federal judges, no matter how well grounded in existing law, and it is for Federal judges overriding any order by Trump on any grounds whatsoever. It was for Obama penalizing whistleblowers, but now undermining the government from within has become \u201cpatriotic\u201d.</p>\n<p>There is no form of legal authority that the left accepts as a permanent institution. It only utilizes forms of authority selectively when it controls them. But when government officials refuse the orders of the duly elected government because their allegiance is to an ideology whose agenda is in conflict with the President and Congress, that\u2019s not activism, protest, politics or civil disobedience; it\u2019s treason.</p>\n<p>After losing Congress, the left consolidated its authority in the White House. After losing the White House, the left shifted its center of authority to Federal judges and unelected government officials. Each defeat led the radicalized Democrats to relocate from more democratic to less democratic institutions.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just hypocrisy. That\u2019s a common political sin. Hypocrites maneuver within the system. The left has no allegiance to the system. It accepts no laws other than those dictated by its ideology.</p>\n<p>Democrats have become radicalized by the left. This doesn\u2019t just mean that they pursue all sorts of bad policies. It means that their first and foremost allegiance is to an ideology, not the Constitution, not our country or our system of government. All of those are only to be used as vehicles for their ideology.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why compromise has become impossible.</p>\n<p>Our system of government was designed to allow different groups to negotiate their differences. But those differences were supposed to be based around finding shared interests. The most profound of these shared interests was that of a common country based around certain civilizational values. The left has replaced these Founding ideas with radically different notions and principles. It has rejected the primary importance of the country. As a result it shares little in the way of interests or values.</p>\n<p>Instead it has retreated to cultural urban and suburban enclaves where it has centralized tremendous amounts of power while disregarding the interests and values of most of the country. If it considers them at all, it is convinced that they will shortly disappear to be replaced by compliant immigrants and college indoctrinated leftists who will form a permanent demographic majority for its agenda.</p>\n<p>But it couldn\u2019t wait that long because it is animated by the conviction that enforcing its ideas is urgent and inevitable. And so it turned what had been a hidden transition into an open break.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>In the hidden transition, its authority figures had hijacked the law and every political office they held to pursue their ideological agenda. The left had used its vast cultural power to manufacture a consensus that was slowly transitioning the country from American values to its values and agendas. The right had proven largely impotent in the face of a program which corrupted and subverted from within.</p>\n<p>The left was enormously successful in this regard. It was so successful that it lost all sense of proportion and decided to be open about its views and to launch a political power struggle after losing an election.</p>\n<p>The Democrats were no longer being slowly injected with leftist ideology. Instead the left openly took over and demanded allegiance to open borders, identity politics and environmental fanaticism. The exodus of voters wiped out the Democrats across much of what the left deemed flyover country.</p>\n<p>The left responded to democratic defeats by retreating deeper into undemocratic institutions, whether it was the bureaucracy or the corporate media, while doubling down on its political radicalism. It is now openly defying the outcome of a national election using a coalition of bureaucrats, corporations, unelected officials, celebrities and reporters that are based out of its cultural and political enclaves.</p>\n<p>It has responded to a lost election by constructing sanctuary cities and states thereby turning a cultural and ideological secession into a legal secession. But while secessionists want to be left alone authoritarians want everyone to follow their laws. The left is an authoritarian movement that wants total compliance with its dictates with severe punishments for those who disobey.</p>\n<p>The left describes its actions as principled. But more accurately they are ideological. Officials at various levels of government have rejected the authority of the President of the United States, of Congress and of the Constitution because those are at odds with their radical ideology. Judges have cloaked this rejection in law. Mayors and governors are not even pretending that their actions are lawful.</p>\n<p>The choices of this civil war are painfully clear.</p>\n<p>We can have a system of government based around the Constitution with democratically elected representatives. Or we can have one based on the ideological principles of the left in which all laws and processes, including elections and the Constitution, are fig leaves for enforcing social justice.</p>\n<p>But we cannot have both.</p>\n<p>Some civil wars happen when a political conflict can\u2019t be resolved at the political level. The really bad ones happen when an irresolvable political conflict combines with an irresolvable cultural conflict.</p>\n<p>That is what we have now.</p>\n<p>The left has made it clear that it will not accept the lawful authority of our system of government. It will not accept the outcome of elections. It will not accept these things because they are at odds with its ideology and because they represent the will of large portions of the country whom they despise.</p>\n<p>The question is what comes next.</p>\n<p>The last time around growing tensions began to explode in violent confrontations between extremists on both sides. These extremists were lauded by moderates who mainstreamed their views. The first Republican president was elected and rejected. The political tensions led to conflict and then civil war.</p>\n<p>The left doesn\u2019t believe in secession. It\u2019s an authoritarian political movement that has lost democratic authority. There is now a political power struggle underway between the democratically elected officials and the undemocratic machinery of government aided by a handful of judges and local elected officials.</p>\n<p>What this really means is that <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">there are two competing governments; the legal government and a treasonous anti-government of the left.</span> </strong>If this political conflict progresses, agencies and individuals at every level of government will be asked to demonstrate their allegiance to these two competing governments. And that can swiftly and explosively transform into an actual civil war.</p>\n<p>There is no sign that the left understands or is troubled by the implications of the conflict it has initiated. And there are few signs that Democrats properly understand the dangerous road that the radical left is drawing them toward. The left assumes that the winners of a democratic election will back down rather than stand on their authority. It is unprepared for the possibility that democracy won\u2019t die in darkness.</p>\n<p>Civil wars end when one side is forced to accept the authority of the other. The left expects everyone to accept its ideological authority. Conservatives expect the left to accept Constitutional authority. The conflict is still political and cultural. It\u2019s being fought in the media and within the government. But if neither side backs down, then it will go beyond words as both sides give contradictory orders.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The left is a treasonous movement</span></strong>. The Democrats became a treasonous organization when they fell under the sway of a movement <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">that rejects our system of government, its laws and its elections.</span></strong> Now their treason is coming to a head. They are engaged in a struggle for power against the government. That\u2019s not protest. It\u2019s not activism. The old treason of the sixties has come of age. A civil war has begun.</p>\n<p>This is a primal conflict between a totalitarian system and a democratic system.

This is what they have, with Obama&#8217;s help, managed to achieve. The simple fact is that Islam is laughing all the way to the mosque &#8211; seeded by Obama, the US Government is seething with traitors &#8216;within the walls&#8217; and until the Trump draining initiative really gets under way and the Colleges and Uni&#8217;s are cleansed of Muslim-led cuckoos, then it will be a tough coup to get things straight again. Firstly DO NOT give ONE single vote to a Muslim in ANY capacity in Government local or National &#8211; you do so at your peril because &#8211; every single vote for a Muslim is a vote for Islam and the introduction of Shariah Law.

We are in a second American civil war \u2014 a war that stems from irreconcilable differences between conservatives and the Left who have formed a treasonous anti-government.\n\nNor can our differences be resolved by secession, because the Left do not want to secede. They want total control.\n\nBelow is Greenfield\u2019s article in its entirety. I cannot recommend it more highly.\n\nH/t FOTM\u2018s Anon\n\nThe left doesn\u2019t want to secede. It wants to rule.\n\nDaniel Greenfield \u2022 March 27, 2017 \u2022 Frontpage Mag\n\nA civil war has begun.\n\nThis civil war is very different than the last one. There are no cannons or cavalry charges. The left doesn\u2019t want to secede. It wants to rule. Political conflicts become civil wars when one side refuses to accept the existing authority. The left has rejected all forms of authority that it doesn\u2019t control.\n\nThe left has rejected the outcome of the last two presidential elections won by Republicans. It has rejected the judicial authority of the Supreme Court when its decisions don\u2019t accord with its agenda. It rejects the legislative authority of Congress when it is not dominated by the left.\n\nIt rejected the Constitution so long ago that it hardly bears mentioning.\n\nIt was for total unilateral executive authority under Obama. And now it\u2019s for states unilaterally deciding what laws they will follow. (As long as that involves defying immigration laws under Trump, not following them under Obama.) It was for the sacrosanct authority of the Senate when it held the majority. Then it decried the Senate as an outmoded institution when the Republicans took it over.\n\nIt was for Obama defying the orders of Federal judges, no matter how well grounded in existing law, and it is for Federal judges overriding any order by Trump on any grounds whatsoever. It was for Obama penalizing whistleblowers, but now undermining the government from within has become \u201cpatriotic\u201d.\n\nThere is no form of legal authority that the left accepts as a permanent institution. It only utilizes forms of authority selectively when it controls them. But when government officials refuse the orders of the duly elected government because their allegiance is to an ideology whose agenda is in conflict with the President and Congress, that\u2019s not activism, protest, politics or civil disobedience; it\u2019s treason.\n\nAfter losing Congress, the left consolidated its authority in the White House. After losing the White House, the left shifted its center of authority to Federal judges and unelected government officials. Each defeat led the radicalized Democrats to relocate from more democratic to less democratic institutions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just hypocrisy. That\u2019s a common political sin. Hypocrites maneuver within the system. The left has no allegiance to the system. It accepts no laws other than those dictated by its ideology.\n\nDemocrats have become radicalized by the left. This doesn\u2019t just mean that they pursue all sorts of bad policies. It means that their first and foremost allegiance is to an ideology, not the Constitution, not our country or our system of government. All of those are only to be used as vehicles for their ideology.\n\nThat\u2019s why compromise has become impossible.\n\nOur system of government was designed to allow different groups to negotiate their differences. But those differences were supposed to be based around finding shared interests. The most profound of these shared interests was that of a common country based around certain civilizational values. The left has replaced these Founding ideas with radically different notions and principles. It has rejected the primary importance of the country. As a result it shares little in the way of interests or values.\n\nInstead it has retreated to cultural urban and suburban enclaves where it has centralized tremendous amounts of power while disregarding the interests and values of most of the country. If it considers them at all, it is convinced that they will shortly disappear to be replaced by compliant immigrants and college indoctrinated leftists who will form a permanent demographic majority for its agenda.\n\nBut it couldn\u2019t wait that long because it is animated by the conviction that enforcing its ideas is urgent and inevitable. And so it turned what had been a hidden transition into an open break.\n\nIn the hidden transition, its authority figures had hijacked the law and every political office they held to pursue their ideological agenda. The left had used its vast cultural power to manufacture a consensus that was slowly transitioning the country from American values to its values and agendas. The right had proven largely impotent in the face of a program which corrupted and subverted from within.\n\nThe left was enormously successful in this regard. It was so successful that it lost all sense of proportion and decided to be open about its views and to launch a political power struggle after losing an election.\n\nThe Democrats were no longer being slowly injected with leftist ideology. Instead the left openly took over and demanded allegiance to open borders, identity politics and environmental fanaticism. The exodus of voters wiped out the Democrats across much of what the left deemed flyover country.\n\nThe left responded to democratic defeats by retreating deeper into undemocratic institutions, whether it was the bureaucracy or the corporate media, while doubling down on its political radicalism. It is now openly defying the outcome of a national election using a coalition of bureaucrats, corporations, unelected officials, celebrities and reporters that are based out of its cultural and political enclaves.\n\nIt has responded to a lost election by constructing sanctuary cities and states thereby turning a cultural and ideological secession into a legal secession. But while secessionists want to be left alone authoritarians want everyone to follow their laws. The left is an authoritarian movement that wants total compliance with its dictates with severe punishments for those who disobey.\n\nThe left describes its actions as principled. But more accurately they are ideological. Officials at various levels of government have rejected the authority of the President of the United States, of Congress and of the Constitution because those are at odds with their radical ideology. Judges have cloaked this rejection in law. Mayors and governors are not even pretending that their actions are lawful.\n\nThe choices of this civil war are painfully clear.\n\nWe can have a system of government based around the Constitution with democratically elected representatives. Or we can have one based on the ideological principles of the left in which all laws and processes, including elections and the Constitution, are fig leaves for enforcing social justice.\n\nBut we cannot have both.\n\nSome civil wars happen when a political conflict can\u2019t be resolved at the political level. The really bad ones happen when an irresolvable political conflict combines with an irresolvable cultural conflict.\n\nThat is what we have now.\n\nThe left has made it clear that it will not accept the lawful authority of our system of government. It will not accept the outcome of elections. It will not accept these things because they are at odds with its ideology and because they represent the will of large portions of the country whom they despise.\n\nThe question is what comes next.\n\nThe last time around growing tensions began to explode in violent confrontations between extremists on both sides. These extremists were lauded by moderates who mainstreamed their views. The first Republican president was elected and rejected. The political tensions led to conflict and then civil war.\n\nThe left doesn\u2019t believe in secession. It\u2019s an authoritarian political movement that has lost democratic authority. There is now a political power struggle underway between the democratically elected officials and the undemocratic machinery of government aided by a handful of judges and local elected officials.\n\nWhat this really means is that there are two competing governments; the legal government and a treasonous anti-government of the left. If this political conflict progresses, agencies and individuals at every level of government will be asked to demonstrate their allegiance to these two competing governments. And that can swiftly and explosively transform into an actual civil war.\n\nThere is no sign that the left understands or is troubled by the implications of the conflict it has initiated. And there are few signs that Democrats properly understand the dangerous road that the radical left is drawing them toward. The left assumes that the winners of a democratic election will back down rather than stand on their authority. It is unprepared for the possibility that democracy won\u2019t die in darkness.\n\nCivil wars end when one side is forced to accept the authority of the other. The left expects everyone to accept its ideological authority. Conservatives expect the left to accept Constitutional authority. The conflict is still political and cultural. It\u2019s being fought in the media and within the government. But if neither side backs down, then it will go beyond words as both sides give contradictory orders.\n\nThe left is a treasonous movement. The Democrats became a treasonous organization when they fell under the sway of a movement that rejects our system of government, its laws and its elections. Now their treason is coming to a head. They are engaged in a struggle for power against the government. That\u2019s not protest. It\u2019s not activism. The old treason of the sixties has come of age. A civil war has begun.\n\nThis is a primal conflict between a totalitarian system and a democratic system. Its outcome will determine whether we will be a free nation or a nation of slaves.\n\nDr. Eowyn\u2019s post first appeared at Fellowship of the Minds", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=584", "https://i2.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/arton1466.jpg?fit=1200%2C900", "https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/america_divided.jpg?w=584", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg"], "videos": []}
