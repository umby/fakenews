Regardless of political allegiance, the facts ought to be known.</p>\n<p>I interviewed Mr. Johnson about his findings and methods of research.</p>\n<p>Q (Rappoport): Your organization has been compiling statistics on crime in North Carolina. Can you give me an overview of what you\u2019ve found?</p>\n<p>A (Johnson): We have found many hundreds of crimes committed by illegal aliens every month. They run the full gamut ie: Failure to appear for previous arrests, DWI, assault on females, drug trafficking, child rape, breaking and entering, receiving stolen goods, illegal possession of firearms, urinating in public, etc\u2026 every conceivable crime you could name.</p>\n<p>Q: What sources did you use to come up with these numbers?</p>\n<p>A: We use actual NC Sheriff, NC Police and NC Highway Patrol arrest records which are public information in NC. I personally scan several thousand arrest records every day to compile our information. In a month\u2019s time, I literally scan 10\u2019s of thousands of arrest records. (These are total arrest records, not simply illegal alien arrest records)</p>\n<p>Q: Have mainstream news outlets been covering this story?</p>\n<p>A: NO. (However, there are a couple of independent NC news websites that have recently started carrying our Monthly Child Rape Reports)</p>\n<p>Q: Have you attempted to contact mainstream newspapers and television news networks with your findings? What\u2019s been the result of that attempt?</p>\n<p>A: I have a list of 350 different media outlets in NC and have, on numerous occasions in the past, sent them our monthly crime reports. I have not received one single response from any of them. In fact, I have been blocked by a number of them from sending them any further emails.</p>\n<p>Q: Have you received much response from people who live in North Carolina?</p>\n<p>A: Yes. NCFIRE has been active in the effort against illegal aliens in NC since 2007. Over the years we have had numerous rallies with crowds ranging from a couple of dozen, to a couple of thousand. Through our email contact list and our social media outlets, we are able to reach 50-60 thousand NC citizens at any given time. We have taken an active roll [sic] at the NC Legislature and worked in an effort to get many illegal immigration enforcement bills through the General Assembly. We have called for the citizens to show up at the committee hearings for these bills and the citizens have responded in large numbers. We also have the support of numerous County Sheriffs and Law enforcement agencies through-out the state.</p>\n<p>Q: In reading through crime reports, how do you know you\u2019re compiling statistics of illegal immigrants committing those crimes, as opposed to, say, people with Hispanic last names? How do you dig into the crime reports?</p>\n<p>A: In the beginning, we were posting any and every crime we could find being committed by an illegal alien in NC. During the past couple of years, we have focused specifically on the crime of child rape/child sexual assault. In many of the posts [articles in the press], the illegal immigration status is mentioned in the article, others we verify by calling the arresting authority and confirm the citizenship or illegal immigration status of the arrested individual. Obviously we don\u2019t publish crimes being committed by citizens. In 10 years of doing this, we have had to retract fewer than 10 postings where we got the citizenship status wrong, (by posting the info on initial confirmation, only to find with further investigation, that the individual was in fact, a citizen).</p>\n<p>While a majority of those in our reports do have Hispanic surnames, the surname of the arrested individual has no bearing as to whether or not we post it. Quite frankly, any name that is not \u201cwhite, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant\u201d or that would not normally have been found in a 1960\u2019s N.C. phone book, we check. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is Asian, Indian, Sudanese, Italian, Greek, Russian, etc\u2026 The fact is, we just don\u2019t find very many that are \u201cother than Hispanic\u201d (child rapes in particular). We post what we find and do not single out or \u201ccherry pick\u201d any particular surname.</p>\n<p>[I check the immigration status of a person who is arrested] through the [arresting] law enforcement agencies themselves. Unless the initial arrest is part of an ongoing investigation, the immigration status of an arrested individual is public information\u2026if I inquire too soon after an arrest (before they [the arresting agencies] have gotten the info [on immigration status] back from ICE or DHS) [a]ll I have to do then, is simply call back at a later time (a few days generally).</p>\n<p>Q: Can you give me the numbers of crimes committed by illegal immigrants you\u2019ve found for the last five years, year by year? And specifically, what crimes do these numbers cover?</p>\n<p>A: No, we don\u2019t have the information broken down that far. Please feel free to research our info to do an analysis that would provide you that info.</p>\n<p>Q: Does your organization receive funding? If so, from whom? Are you registered as a non-profit?</p>\n<p>A: We receive no funding from anyone. I fund this organization out of my back pocket. Until a couple of years ago, we were a registered non-profit in N.C. and received minimal donations from our subscribers ($5,000 or less in any given year). As we became larger and more effective at putting pressure on our legislators, we were exceeding the limitations of the 501(c)(3) as it pertains to issue agenda politics and lobbying. Complaints were filed against us and we were forced to dissolve the 501(c)(3) non-profit status or register as a 501(c)(4). At the time, the Obama Administration and the IRS were targeting conservative 501(c)(4)\u2019s and I didn\u2019t want any part of that. I dissolved the 501(c)(3) and removed any reference to donations from our website and all of our social media outlets.</p>\n<p>Q: Why do you believe you\u2019ve received the cold shoulder from so many media outlets?</p>\n<p>A: Illegal aliens committing crimes against citizens doesn\u2019t fit their socialist, open borders agenda. You have to remember, \u201cthey\u2019re only here to make a better life for themselves and do the jobs American\u2019s won\u2019t do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Q: What about North Carolina politicians and bureaucrats? Have you approached many of them? If so, what responses have you gotten?</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>A: Yes, we have worked closely with numerous NC House members, in crafting language of a number of immigration enforcement bills. Some have passed, some have not. We are actually making some gains in last session of the NCGA [North Carolina General Assembly] (2015-2016), we were able to pass <a href=\"http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015/Bills/House/PDF/H318v8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><em>HB318 \u2013 Protect NC Workers Act</em></a>, that had a number of measures designed to crack down on the illegal alien population in NC and those who may hire or harbor them, as well as prevent them from receiving any type of State level social service (ie: sanctuary city policies, acceptable forms of valid ID, etc..).</p>\n<p>As you are no doubt aware, all of this was taking place during the Obama Presidency when they were refusing to enforce many aspects of immigration laws and going so far as to offer temporary protected status to millions of illegals in the US. (DACA, DAPA, etc\u2026)</p>\n<p>This session, they\u2019re [sic] are 6 bills introduced in the NC House and 2 in the NC Senate that create new laws, add to or further enforce the existing laws already in place that deal with illegal aliens in NC. We have them all listed with links <a href=\"http://www.ncfire.info/\" target=\"_blank\">on our website</a>.</p>\n<p>Q: You seem to be talking about a crime wave that most people in North Carolina are unaware of. Is that the case?</p>\n<p>A: I think a majority of NC residents are aware of crimes being committed by illegal aliens, just not the extent of it. Each year, as we grow our membership, we are making more and more of the citizenry aware of the magnitude of the problem. Certainly more are aware if it now than when we started in 2007. Enough of them are aware of it now that we\u2019re making a difference at the NC General Assembly level in getting immigration enforcement bills passed and signed into law.</p>\n<p>In the response to your 1st question, I should have clarified WHY we have focused on one particular crime. As I said, in the beginning, we were posting any and all crimes by illegals that we could find, however, the number of crimes we were finding, being committed by illegals, became too much for us to keep up with, as far as verifying and posting all we could find in a month\u2019s time. I made the decision to focus on the child rapes that we were finding, as those are the most heinous in my humble opinion.</p>\n<p>Q: I need a total number for this specific crime\u2014child rape/child sexual assault\u2014you\u2019ve verified as being committed by illegal immigrants over the past 2 years. Otherwise, I\u2019m dealing with a generality.</p>\n<p>A: As you can see from our website, we went through a 17 month period of tracking this particular crime (Nov. 2013 \u2013 March 2015). The methodology I used at the time was to list every crime report we could find through law enforcement arrest reports AND every scheduled court case we could find for the month. All of the court case data is available online trough [sic] the <a href=\"http://www1.aoc.state.nc.us/www/calendars/CriminalQuery.html\" target=\"_blank\">NC Courts System website</a>. Those monthly reports showed a total of arrests AND court dates (for previously arrested illegal aliens) that occurred in any particular month. Needless to say, it was an enormous amount of work and research.</p>\n<p>I discontinued that particular assignment after March of 2015. I resumed the effort in May of 2016 using only the illegal aliens ARRESTED during one month\u2019s time frame. So two separate methodologies were used for two separate blocks of time. All that being said, it would be a tremendous amount of work to go back through each and every report to total up the confirmed illegal aliens arrested (not including the court cases) for 17 months to come up with a 2 year total. Some of those reports are 40 \u2013 50 pages long and it is not a task which I care to do.</p>\n<p>The latest 10 month period of reporting (May 2016 \u2013 February 2017) only include confirmed illegal aliens ARRESTED for these crimes in any particular month. So let\u2019s use the previous 10 months time-frame data.</p>\n<p>Every individual, listed in each of the last 10 months of the \u201cNCFIRE Monthly Child Rape Reports\u201d (May of 2016 \u2013 February of 2017), is a confirmed illegal alien. Those totals are: In 10 months, 170 separate confirmed illegal aliens, were charged with 592 separate incidences of child rape/child sexual assault/indecent liberties with a minor. (The current month\u2019s report, March 2017 already has 8 confirmed illegal aliens that have amassed 22 separate charges of child rape/sexual assault/indecent liberties with a child, which I have NOT included in those numbers. I will publish that report sometime in early April 2017. Obviously they lag one month behind for compiling and publishing purposes). I have personally confirmed each and every one of them through one or more of the aforementioned sources and or methods.</p>\n<p>Just using the raw numbers associated with each monthly report (arrests and court cases), every illegal alien arrested for these particular sexual acts against children in NC, averages 4.6 charges per individual. That\u2019s not to say that every illegal alien in NC rapes 4.6 different children, only that each one, on average, commits 4.6 sexual acts per arrest.</p>\n<p>Q: Finally, I assume since you\u2019re dealing with arrests data, you\u2019re not tracking convictions. Correct?</p>\n<p>A: Correct. We are not tracking convictions.</p>\n<p>\u2014end of interview\u2014</p>\n<p>My comments: Mr. Johnson was forthcoming about his methods of research and analysis. One could criticize his focus on arrests rather than convictions. On the other hand, focusing on convictions could be misleading, if defendants are being released without trial or pled out on lesser charges, owing to political correctness.</p>\n<p>But the question is, has Mr. Johnson\u2019s extensive investigation turned up enough evidence to indicate there is a very serious problem; a problem that has been ignored and overlooked and even suppressed from public view?</p>\n<p>I believe the answer is yes. From his account, he carried out the investigation on his own, as one man. Who knows what a determined team would discover?</p>\n<p>Again, there will be those who reject Mr. Johnson\u2019s findings out of hand, because they don\u2019t want to deal with them, and because they are \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is not a valid reason to turn away.</p>\n<p><em>Jon Rappoport</em></p>\n<p><em>To read about Jon\u2019s mega-collection, <strong>Power Outside The Matrix</strong>, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/power-outside-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>The author of three explosive collections, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\">THE MATRIX REVEALED</a>, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">EXIT FROM THE MATRIX</a>, and <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/power-outside-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX</a>, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29<sup>th</sup> District of California.

Can you give me an overview of what you\u2019ve found?\n\nA (Johnson): We have found many hundreds of crimes committed by illegal aliens every month. They run the full gamut ie: Failure to appear for previous arrests, DWI, assault on females, drug trafficking, child rape, breaking and entering, receiving stolen goods, illegal possession of firearms, urinating in public, etc\u2026 every conceivable crime you could name.\n\nQ: What sources did you use to come up with these numbers?\n\nA: We use actual NC Sheriff, NC Police and NC Highway Patrol arrest records which are public information in NC. I personally scan several thousand arrest records every day to compile our information. In a month\u2019s time, I literally scan 10\u2019s of thousands of arrest records. (These are total arrest records, not simply illegal alien arrest records)\n\nQ: Have mainstream news outlets been covering this story?\n\nA: NO. (However, there are a couple of independent NC news websites that have recently started carrying our Monthly Child Rape Reports)\n\nQ: Have you attempted to contact mainstream newspapers and television news networks with your findings? What\u2019s been the result of that attempt?\n\nA: I have a list of 350 different media outlets in NC and have, on numerous occasions in the past, sent them our monthly crime reports. I have not received one single response from any of them. In fact, I have been blocked by a number of them from sending them any further emails.\n\nQ: Have you received much response from people who live in North Carolina?\n\nA: Yes. NCFIRE has been active in the effort against illegal aliens in NC since 2007. Over the years we have had numerous rallies with crowds ranging from a couple of dozen, to a couple of thousand. Through our email contact list and our social media outlets, we are able to reach 50-60 thousand NC citizens at any given time. We have taken an active roll [sic] at the NC Legislature and worked in an effort to get many illegal immigration enforcement bills through the General Assembly. We have called for the citizens to show up at the committee hearings for these bills and the citizens have responded in large numbers. We also have the support of numerous County Sheriffs and Law enforcement agencies through-out the state.\n\nQ: In reading through crime reports, how do you know you\u2019re compiling statistics of illegal immigrants committing those crimes, as opposed to, say, people with Hispanic last names? How do you dig into the crime reports?\n\nA: In the beginning, we were posting any and every crime we could find being committed by an illegal alien in NC. During the past couple of years, we have focused specifically on the crime of child rape/child sexual assault. In many of the posts [articles in the press], the illegal immigration status is mentioned in the article, others we verify by calling the arresting authority and confirm the citizenship or illegal immigration status of the arrested individual. Obviously we don\u2019t publish crimes being committed by citizens. In 10 years of doing this, we have had to retract fewer than 10 postings where we got the citizenship status wrong, (by posting the info on initial confirmation, only to find with further investigation, that the individual was in fact, a citizen).\n\nWhile a majority of those in our reports do have Hispanic surnames, the surname of the arrested individual has no bearing as to whether or not we post it. Quite frankly, any name that is not \u201cwhite, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant\u201d or that would not normally have been found in a 1960\u2019s N.C. phone book, we check. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is Asian, Indian, Sudanese, Italian, Greek, Russian, etc\u2026 The fact is, we just don\u2019t find very many that are \u201cother than Hispanic\u201d (child rapes in particular). We post what we find and do not single out or \u201ccherry pick\u201d any particular surname.\n\n[I check the immigration status of a person who is arrested] through the [arresting] law enforcement agencies themselves. Unless the initial arrest is part of an ongoing investigation, the immigration status of an arrested individual is public information\u2026if I inquire too soon after an arrest (before they [the arresting agencies] have gotten the info [on immigration status] back from ICE or DHS) [a]ll I have to do then, is simply call back at a later time (a few days generally).\n\nQ: Can you give me the numbers of crimes committed by illegal immigrants you\u2019ve found for the last five years, year by year? And specifically, what crimes do these numbers cover?\n\nA: No, we don\u2019t have the information broken down that far. Please feel free to research our info to do an analysis that would provide you that info.\n\nQ: Does your organization receive funding? If so, from whom? Are you registered as a non-profit?\n\nA: We receive no funding from anyone. I fund this organization out of my back pocket. Until a couple of years ago, we were a registered non-profit in N.C. and received minimal donations from our subscribers ($5,000 or less in any given year). As we became larger and more effective at putting pressure on our legislators, we were exceeding the limitations of the 501(c)(3) as it pertains to issue agenda politics and lobbying. Complaints were filed against us and we were forced to dissolve the 501(c)(3) non-profit status or register as a 501(c)(4). At the time, the Obama Administration and the IRS were targeting conservative 501(c)(4)\u2019s and I didn\u2019t want any part of that. I dissolved the 501(c)(3) and removed any reference to donations from our website and all of our social media outlets.\n\nQ: Why do you believe you\u2019ve received the cold shoulder from so many media outlets?\n\nA: Illegal aliens committing crimes against citizens doesn\u2019t fit their socialist, open borders agenda. You have to remember, \u201cthey\u2019re only here to make a better life for themselves and do the jobs American\u2019s won\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nQ: What about North Carolina politicians and bureaucrats? Have you approached many of them? If so, what responses have you gotten?\n\nA: Yes, we have worked closely with numerous NC House members, in crafting language of a number of immigration enforcement bills. Some have passed, some have not. We are actually making some gains in last session of the NCGA [North Carolina General Assembly] (2015-2016), we were able to pass HB318 \u2013 Protect NC Workers Act, that had a number of measures designed to crack down on the illegal alien population in NC and those who may hire or harbor them, as well as prevent them from receiving any type of State level social service (ie: sanctuary city policies, acceptable forms of valid ID, etc..).\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, all of this was taking place during the Obama Presidency when they were refusing to enforce many aspects of immigration laws and going so far as to offer temporary protected status to millions of illegals in the US. (DACA, DAPA, etc\u2026)\n\nThis session, they\u2019re [sic] are 6 bills introduced in the NC House and 2 in the NC Senate that create new laws, add to or further enforce the existing laws already in place that deal with illegal aliens in NC. We have them all listed with links on our website.\n\nQ: You seem to be talking about a crime wave that most people in North Carolina are unaware of. Is that the case?\n\nA: I think a majority of NC residents are aware of crimes being committed by illegal aliens, just not the extent of it. Each year, as we grow our membership, we are making more and more of the citizenry aware of the magnitude of the problem. Certainly more are aware if it now than when we started in 2007. Enough of them are aware of it now that we\u2019re making a difference at the NC General Assembly level in getting immigration enforcement bills passed and signed into law.\n\nIn the response to your 1st question, I should have clarified WHY we have focused on one particular crime. As I said, in the beginning, we were posting any and all crimes by illegals that we could find, however, the number of crimes we were finding, being committed by illegals, became too much for us to keep up with, as far as verifying and posting all we could find in a month\u2019s time. I made the decision to focus on the child rapes that we were finding, as those are the most heinous in my humble opinion.\n\nQ: I need a total number for this specific crime\u2014child rape/child sexual assault\u2014you\u2019ve verified as being committed by illegal immigrants over the past 2 years. Otherwise, I\u2019m dealing with a generality.\n\nA: As you can see from our website, we went through a 17 month period of tracking this particular crime (Nov. 2013 \u2013 March 2015). The methodology I used at the time was to list every crime report we could find through law enforcement arrest reports AND every scheduled court case we could find for the month. All of the court case data is available online trough [sic] the NC Courts System website. Those monthly reports showed a total of arrests AND court dates (for previously arrested illegal aliens) that occurred in any particular month. Needless to say, it was an enormous amount of work and research.\n\nI discontinued that particular assignment after March of 2015. I resumed the effort in May of 2016 using only the illegal aliens ARRESTED during one month\u2019s time frame. So two separate methodologies were used for two separate blocks of time. All that being said, it would be a tremendous amount of work to go back through each and every report to total up the confirmed illegal aliens arrested (not including the court cases) for 17 months to come up with a 2 year total. Some of those reports are 40 \u2013 50 pages long and it is not a task which I care to do.\n\nThe latest 10 month period of reporting (May 2016 \u2013 February 2017) only include confirmed illegal aliens ARRESTED for these crimes in any particular month. So let\u2019s use the previous 10 months time-frame data.\n\nEvery individual, listed in each of the last 10 months of the \u201cNCFIRE Monthly Child Rape Reports\u201d (May of 2016 \u2013 February of 2017), is a confirmed illegal alien. Those totals are: In 10 months, 170 separate confirmed illegal aliens, were charged with 592 separate incidences of child rape/child sexual assault/indecent liberties with a minor. (The current month\u2019s report, March 2017 already has 8 confirmed illegal aliens that have amassed 22 separate charges of child rape/sexual assault/indecent liberties with a child, which I have NOT included in those numbers. I will publish that report sometime in early April 2017. Obviously they lag one month behind for compiling and publishing purposes). I have personally confirmed each and every one of them through one or more of the aforementioned sources and or methods.\n\nJust using the raw numbers associated with each monthly report (arrests and court cases), every illegal alien arrested for these particular sexual acts against children in NC, averages 4.6 charges per individual. That\u2019s not to say that every illegal alien in NC rapes 4.6 different children, only that each one, on average, commits 4.6 sexual acts per arrest.\n\nQ: Finally, I assume since you\u2019re dealing with arrests data, you\u2019re not tracking convictions. Correct?\n\nA: Correct. We are not tracking convictions.\n\n\u2014end of interview\u2014\n\nMy comments: Mr. Johnson was forthcoming about his methods of research and analysis. One could criticize his focus on arrests rather than convictions. On the other hand, focusing on convictions could be misleading, if defendants are being released without trial or pled out on lesser charges, owing to political correctness.\n\nBut the question is, has Mr. Johnson\u2019s extensive investigation turned up enough evidence to indicate there is a very serious problem; a problem that has been ignored and overlooked and even suppressed from public view?\n\nI believe the answer is yes. From his account, he carried out the investigation on his own, as one man. Who knows what a determined team would discover?\n\nAgain, there will be those who reject Mr. Johnson\u2019s findings out of hand, because they don\u2019t want to deal with them, and because they are \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201d\n\nThis is not a valid reason to turn away.\n\nJon Rappoport\n\nTo read about Jon\u2019s mega-collection, Power Outside The Matrix, click here.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
