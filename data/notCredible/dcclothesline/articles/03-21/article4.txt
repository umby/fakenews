It\u2019s the same question I close this post with.</p>\n<p>If there is no #Pizzagate, and there are no massive pedophile rings connected to the DNC outside the minds of crazy \u201cconspiracy theorists,\u201d then how is it that <a href=\"http://freedomoutpost.com/enforcing-the-law-against-human-trafficking-trump1500-in-1-month-obama-less-than-400-in-1-year/\">over 1,500 child sex offenders have been apprehended by Trump\u2019s administration in just the first two months he\u2019s been in office</a>? Why has wasn\u2019t the previous Democrat administration able to do something if Trump has rounded up 1,500 in about 60 days?</p>\n<p>PizzaGate is one of two things:</p>\n<p><i>1. Either #Pizzagate is \u201cfake news,\u201d like the media and politicians would have you believe, but then that means that every arresting officer and agent involved in apprehending the 1,500 child sex offenders the last 60 days must have done so knowing the people they apprehended were innocent; or</i></p>\n<p><i>2. It&#8217;s far more likely the all the men and women on the ground making the arrests are honest people, there absolutely IS something to the story, which means the mainstream media and Washington politicians are lying to you. </i></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that simple. It\u2019s one or the other. It cannot be both. Once you realize that, then ask yourself who is more likely to lie? A handful of super elites, they very same elites who are alleged to be involved in the scandal, or the hundreds, if not thousands of every day men and women on the ground who apprehended over 1,500 child sex offenders? You tell me which is more likely\u2026 then buckle up for this one\u2026</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QvS3jjlE-s\" width=\"660\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/608g7h/the_white_house_intruder_was_a_pizzagate/\"><b>The Following Comes from the Conspiracy Reddit:</b></a></p>\n<p>A man has been discovered on YouTube, called Jonathan with a video titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZtcUSz1hjY\">&#8220;Trump-Russia&#8221; Dirty Dossier</a>, <em><strong>uploaded on Feb 26th 2017. </strong></em>In this video he speaks about how people he knew tried<em><b>ganging up on him to partake in sexual abuse.</b> </em>The guy decided to look into these people and why they were after him and sent the material to the police, but they weren&#8217;t interested.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jZtcUSz1hjY\" width=\"660\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhQ51gm3eyU\">another video</a> on March 4 2017, the guy speaks about how his room mate in 2016 was a cyber-stalker/pedo/predator with strange tendencies he didn&#8217;t realise till later on. He says he was unfortunately fooled into signing some life insurance scam through his family and that room mate of whom all didn&#8217;t like him. <b><i>Later in the year he noticed his family and room mate was planning to kill him after discovering a well-set out plan of how such was to happen which he began to compile together to later take legal action.

It\u2019s the same question I close this post with.\n\nIf there is no #Pizzagate, and there are no massive pedophile rings connected to the DNC outside the minds of crazy \u201cconspiracy theorists,\u201d then how is it that over 1,500 child sex offenders have been apprehended by Trump\u2019s administration in just the first two months he\u2019s been in office? Why has wasn\u2019t the previous Democrat administration able to do something if Trump has rounded up 1,500 in about 60 days?\n\nPizzaGate is one of two things:\n\n1. Either #Pizzagate is \u201cfake news,\u201d like the media and politicians would have you believe, but then that means that every arresting officer and agent involved in apprehending the 1,500 child sex offenders the last 60 days must have done so knowing the people they apprehended were innocent; or\n\n2. It\u2019s far more likely the all the men and women on the ground making the arrests are honest people, there absolutely IS something to the story, which means the mainstream media and Washington politicians are lying to you.\n\nIt\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s one or the other. It cannot be both. Once you realize that, then ask yourself who is more likely to lie? A handful of super elites, they very same elites who are alleged to be involved in the scandal, or the hundreds, if not thousands of every day men and women on the ground who apprehended over 1,500 child sex offenders? You tell me which is more likely\u2026 then buckle up for this one\u2026\n\nThe Following Comes from the Conspiracy Reddit:\n\nA man has been discovered on YouTube, called Jonathan with a video titled \u201cTrump-Russia\u201d Dirty Dossier, uploaded on Feb 26th 2017. In this video he speaks about how people he knew triedganging up on him to partake in sexual abuse. The guy decided to look into these people and why they were after him and sent the material to the police, but they weren\u2019t interested.\n\nIn another video on March 4 2017, the guy speaks about how his room mate in 2016 was a cyber-stalker/pedo/predator with strange tendencies he didn\u2019t realise till later on. He says he was unfortunately fooled into signing some life insurance scam through his family and that room mate of whom all didn\u2019t like him. Later in the year he noticed his family and room mate was planning to kill him after discovering a well-set out plan of how such was to happen which he began to compile together to later take legal action. He soon compiled enough, handing it in to the FBI & police.\n\nHe says his \u201cdossier\u201d then got flipped around and parts leaked to press with what seems to be a rewrite to make it sound like it was Trump of whom did all these actions, which he says was totally false. He says the dossier he had handed in, which included info from his \u201ccreepy\u201d roommate mentioned the DNC. Videos, photos and text of a setup to sexual assault. This part doesn\u2019t exactly make sense, as he speaks about the Russian dossier as if it was about sexual activity but it barely mentions that \u2013 a possible sign there is more pages of the fake Russian dossier to come, or indeed a completely different one.\n\nOn March 8th, the same guy uploads a video called \u201cIntroduction\u201d where he says he\u2019s the author of the dossier that has been in the news, showing a Californian photo ID 0:15 to the camera with the name Jonathan Tran. He announces that he is in Washington DC saying he can\u2019t speak why he\u2019s coming out of hiding and ends the video there.\n\nFast forward two days to March 10th and the white house grounds was breached by a man called Jonathan Tran.\n\nJonathan Tran, 26 Mr Tran, who comes from Milpitas, California, had reportedly been spotted \u201clooming around\u201d Washington\u2019s Pennsylvania Avenue, where the White House stands, nearly six hours before his arrest.\n\nBBC Reports:\n\nThe US Secret Service has released new details of last week\u2019s White House fence-jumping incident, in which an intruder was discovered just steps from the main building.\n\nJonathan Tran, 26, was in the grounds for more than 16 minutes before he was detained, it said.\n\nHe now faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nIn a statement, the Secret Service said it was \u201cextremely disappointed and angry\u201d about the events of 10 March.\n\nMr Tran did not gain entry to the White House, where President Donald Trump was staying at the time.\n\nHowever, Congressman Jason Chaffetz \u2013 whose House Oversight Committee oversees the Secret Service \u2013 claimed the intruder had managed to rattle a door-handle at the South Portico entrance.\n\nAccording to court documents, Mr Tran told federal agents that he was a friend of the president and had an appointment. He was carrying two cans of mace, a US passport, a computer and one of Mr Trump\u2019s books, authorities said.\n\nThe president praised the Secret Service for doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d in apprehending the intruder.\n\nHow did he get in?\n\nMr Tran had managed to climb a 5ft (1.5m) fence near the US Treasury Department, which is next to the White House. He then scaled an 8ft vehicle gate, and a shorter fence near the east wing of the White House grounds.\n\nCNN reports that he set off several alarms after jumping the fence, but was able to avoid other sensors.\n\nMr Tran, who comes from Milpitas, California, had reportedly been spotted \u201clooming around\u201d Washington\u2019s Pennsylvania Avenue, where the White House stands, nearly six hours before his arrest.\n\n\n\nThe Secret Service said it had taken immediate steps to avoid further security lapses, and that over 50 people had been interviewed about the incident.\n\nThe intrusion was the latest in a series of breaches at the White House in recent years.\n\nSecurity has been enhanced. In 2015, sharp spikes were installed on top of the black iron fence that circles the property.\n\nThe Conspiracy Reddit Continues:\n\nJonathan from the youtube channel was the Jonathan who trespassed.\n\nYou can view his court sketch photo here, as seen in the media. Compare that to his selfie herediscovered via his Google+ youtube page.\n\nUsing \u201csearch by image\u201d I discovered this photo of him, found also on his google+ page links to his ResearchGate page which points out he\u2019s from San Jose in Cali. Back to the video on YouTube and if you remember, he had a Californian photo ID 0:15.\n\nOne must wonder what information he had that we haven\u2019t yet had\u2026\n\nIf you happen to be someone who hasn\u2019t looked into #Pizzagate at all, mainly because the very same people who\u2019ve been lying to you about everything for years have told you it\u2019s \u201cfake news,\u201d then I hope you\u2019ll cease exercise contempt prior to investigation for just 17:00 minutes and watch the video below.\n\nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost\n\nMichael DePinto is a member of the fast growing un-silent American majority that is sick of the insanity going on in this country right now.
