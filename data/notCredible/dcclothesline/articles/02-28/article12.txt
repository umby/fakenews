Penney and Family Christian Stores are the latest retail giants to announce widespread store closings. As you will see below, J.C. Penney plans to close between 130 <span id=\"more-69992\"></span>and 140 stores, and Family Christian is closing all of their 240 stores. In recent months the stock market <a title=\"has been absolutely soaring\" href=\"http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/virtually-everyone-agrees-that-current-stock-market-valuations-are-not-sustainable-and-that-a-great-crash-is-coming\">has been absolutely soaring</a>, and so most people have simply assumed that the \u201creal economy\u201d must be doing well. But that is not the case at all. In fact, the <a title=\"retail apocalypse\" href=\"http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/tag/retail-apocalypse\">retail apocalypse</a> that I have been documenting for quite some time appears to be gaining momentum.</p>\n<p>J.C. Penney is not in as rough shape as Sears is just yet, but it is definitely on a similar trajectory. In the end, they are both headed for bankruptcy. That is why it wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise when J.C. Penney announced that they are <a title=\"getting rid of about 6,000 workers and closing at least 130 stores\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/02/24/jc-penney-store-closures/98344540/\" target=\"_blank\">getting rid of about 6,000 workers and closing at least 130 stores</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>J.C. Penney (JCP) plans to close 130 to 140 stores and offer buyouts to 6,000 workers as the department-store industry sags in competition with online sellers and nimble niche retailers.</p>\n<p>The company said Friday that it would shutter 13% to 14% of its locations and introduce new goods and services aimed at the shifting preferences of its customer base.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, many observers were quite surprised when Family Christian Stores decided to fold up shop for good. They were known as the largest Christian retailer on the entire planet, but now after 85 years <a title=\"they are going out of business forever\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/02/23/retail-chain-family-christian-plans-after-85-years/98326140/\" target=\"_blank\">they are going out of business forever</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>Family Christian, which bills itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest retailer of Christian-themed merchandise,\u201d announced Thursday it is closing after 85 years.</p>\n<p>The non-profit company, employing more than 3,000 people in 240 stores in 36 states, said in a brief statement that the retailer had been facing declining sales since filing for bankruptcy protection in 2015 and had no choice but to shut down.</p></blockquote>\n<p>These two announcements are part of larger trend that we have been witnessing all over the country. As I have documented <a title=\"previously\" href=\"http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/its-a-retail-apocalypse-sears-macys-and-the-limited-are-all-closing-stores\">previously</a>, Macy\u2019s announced that it would be closing 100 stores earlier this year, and about the same time Sears said that it would be closing another 150 stores.</p>\n<p>Back in 2010, Sears had a staggering 3,555 stores.</p>\n<p>Before their recent announcement, Sears was down to 1,503 stores, and now this latest round of cuts will leave them with somewhere around 1,350.</p>\n<p>Of course it won\u2019t be too long before Sears has zero stores, and my regular readers know that I have been talking about the demise of Sears for a very long time.</p>\n<p>The cold, hard truth of the matter is that the \u201creal economy\u201d is a total mess, and that is one of the primary reasons why these ridiculous stock market valuations that we are seeing right now <a title=\"are not sustainable\" href=\"http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/virtually-everyone-agrees-that-current-stock-market-valuations-are-not-sustainable-and-that-a-great-crash-is-coming\">are not sustainable</a>.</p>\n<p>One expert that agrees with my assessment is former Reagan Administration White House Budget Director David Stockman. In a recent interview, he explained why he believes that <a title=\"\u201ceverything will grind to a halt\u201d\" href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-26/stockman-after-march-15-everything-will-grind-halt\" target=\"_blank\">\u201ceverything will grind to a halt\u201d</a> after March 15th\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stockman, who wrote a book titled \u201c<a title=\"Trumped\" href=\"http://amzn.to/2lebazV\" target=\"_blank\">Trumped</a>\u201d predicting a Trump victory in 2016, says, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a snowball\u2019s chance in the hot place that\u2019s going to happen. This is delusional. <strong>This is the greatest suckers\u2019 rally of all time</strong>. It is based on pure hopium and not any analysis at all as what it will take to push through a big tax cut. Donald Trump is in a trap. Today the debt is $20 trillion. It\u2019s 106% of GDP. . . .<strong>Trump is inheriting a built-in deficit of $10 trillion over the next decade under current policies that are built in</strong>. Yet, he wants more defense spending, not less. He wants drastic sweeping tax cuts for corporations and individuals. He wants to spend more money on border security and law enforcement. He\u2019s going to do more for the veterans. He wants this big trillion dollar infrastructure program. You put all that together and it\u2019s madness. <strong>It doesn\u2019t even begin to add up, and it won\u2019t happen when you are struggling with the $10 trillion of debt that\u2019s coming down the pike and the $20 trillion that\u2019s already on the books.\u201d</strong></p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>Then, Stockman drops this bomb and says<strong>:</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>\u201cI think what people are missing is this date, March 15<sup>th</sup>2017. That\u2019s the day that this debt ceiling holiday that Obama and Boehner put together right before the last election in October of 2015.</strong> That holiday expires. The debt ceiling will freeze in at $20 trillion. It will then be law. It will be a hard stop. The Treasury will have roughly $200 billion in cash. We are burning cash at a $75 billion a month rate. By summer, they will be out of cash. <strong>Then we will be in the mother of all debt ceiling crises. Everything will grind to a halt. I think we will have a government shutdown. There will not be Obama Care repeal and replace. There will be no tax cut. There will be no infrastructure stimulus. There will be just one giant fiscal bloodbath over a debt ceiling that has to be increased and no one wants to vote for.\u201d</strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<p>In that same interview, Stockman also predicted that \u201c<a title=\"markets will easily correct by 20% and probably a lot more\" href=\"https://z3news.com/w/david-stockman-big-events-coming-march-15-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">markets will easily correct by 20% and probably a lot more</a>\u201c, and he noted the glaring disconnect between current stock prices and how the U.S. economy <a title=\"is actually performing\" href=\"https://z3news.com/w/david-stockman-big-events-coming-march-15-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">is actually performing</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe S&amp;P 500 has been trading <strong>at 26 times earnings</strong> while earnings have been dropping <strong>for the past six or seven quarters</strong>. There is <strong>no booming recovery coming.</strong> There is going to be a recession and there will be no stimulus baton to bail it out.

There have been other retail chain stores that closed, department stores, drug stores, but new ones always took their place. K-Mart was huge in the 1960&#8217;s and by early 1970, their empty stores were everywhere, with their parking lots looking like cemeteries.<br />\nThis article fails to mention Walmart as a major cause of other stores losing business, and Internet sales continue to boom even as the department stores lose business. Why? Because it&#8217;s so CONVENIENT. I do all my Walmart shopping ONLINE, with FREE SHIPPING. Any combined purchase over $35 ships free. Then there&#8217;s eBay.</p>\n<p>Pres. Trump is out to cut both regulations and government staff. I expect to see the Federal civilian employee payroll cut drastically, and some agencies entirely eliminated, such as the EPA. Trump is cutting government costs while doing a variety of things to boost our GNP while reducing our huge trade deficit. I fully expect to see the Trump administration to reverse that and turn it into a trade surplus. </p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t spend all your money on survival rations that keep for 50 years, just yet.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-22648\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-22648\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-22648\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-22648\">Savvy1Sez</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-22648\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-22648\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>You have allowed your conditioned hatred and bigotry to consume you, blinding you from seeing the  true picture for a long, long time. The outsourcing and dismantling of our country, America, (for greedy, nefarious purposes), began long before Obama&#8217;s Administration, though they followed through with the agenda as planned. Could the Trump be doing the same? What are we really being set up for, that is the $64M question.</p>\n<p>How many decades ago did you not recognize that our manufacturing industries etc were leaving America for foreign shores to make wealthier, the 1%ers? Americans (actually humanity) have been and are being replaced by &#8220;advanced technology&#8221;. Automate the factory and eliminate paychecks, benefits, &#8220;ungrateful, lazy worthless eaters&#8221; and replace mankind with profitable, efficient, compliant automation, &#8220;robot-izing America&#8221;. What aspect of our society has not yet been impacted with automated and robotic everything besides the politicians, lawyers and 1%ers? Need a reporter, call a drone.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t you get it yet? We&#8217;ve all been played in a huge way through manipulation and conditioning by many greedy, nefarious, evil-doers. Awake yet? Is it time for the &#8220;icing-on-the-cake scenario&#8221;, depopulation in the stick of a vaccine or flu shot. Or maybe a mass epidemic dispensed through chem-trails or poisoning our foods and water sources. Oh darn! Our trusted leaders would never do anything to harm us, i.e. illegally invade many countries while sending our children off to do their dirty work of killing (depopulating) for ?, oil, resources, more wealth as they fund the invasions and then, rebuild the countries they&#8217;ve just destroyed via non-compete contracts all with American tax payer money. </p>\n<p>Get your head out of your butt so you can see what has really been going on for 50+ years and by whom. The slowed-down conditioning we&#8217;ve all be educated to believe is reality has all been lies. Instead of seeing what they&#8217;ve been doing to us we became blinded by their conditioning, divide and conquer agenda, as history repeats itself. If we are hateful and intolerant of each other (but, why?), then we will stay blinded and divided for them and not see who they truly are and what evils they do.</p>\n<p>You aren&#8217;t very good at history or you&#8217;d know the previous 11 Presidents were all alleged Caucasians and they laid the ground-work that the puppet-strings, Obama danced to with a few side-steps of his own thrown in as they all did.

Penney and Family Christian Stores are the latest retail giants to announce widespread store closings. As you will see below, J.C. Penney plans to close between 130 and 140 stores, and Family Christian is closing all of their 240 stores. In recent months the stock market has been absolutely soaring, and so most people have simply assumed that the \u201creal economy\u201d must be doing well. But that is not the case at all. In fact, the retail apocalypse that I have been documenting for quite some time appears to be gaining momentum.\n\nJ.C. Penney is not in as rough shape as Sears is just yet, but it is definitely on a similar trajectory. In the end, they are both headed for bankruptcy. That is why it wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise when J.C. Penney announced that they are getting rid of about 6,000 workers and closing at least 130 stores\u2026\n\nJ.C. Penney (JCP) plans to close 130 to 140 stores and offer buyouts to 6,000 workers as the department-store industry sags in competition with online sellers and nimble niche retailers. The company said Friday that it would shutter 13% to 14% of its locations and introduce new goods and services aimed at the shifting preferences of its customer base.\n\nMeanwhile, many observers were quite surprised when Family Christian Stores decided to fold up shop for good. They were known as the largest Christian retailer on the entire planet, but now after 85 years they are going out of business forever\u2026\n\nFamily Christian, which bills itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest retailer of Christian-themed merchandise,\u201d announced Thursday it is closing after 85 years. The non-profit company, employing more than 3,000 people in 240 stores in 36 states, said in a brief statement that the retailer had been facing declining sales since filing for bankruptcy protection in 2015 and had no choice but to shut down.\n\nThese two announcements are part of larger trend that we have been witnessing all over the country. As I have documented previously, Macy\u2019s announced that it would be closing 100 stores earlier this year, and about the same time Sears said that it would be closing another 150 stores.\n\nBack in 2010, Sears had a staggering 3,555 stores.\n\nBefore their recent announcement, Sears was down to 1,503 stores, and now this latest round of cuts will leave them with somewhere around 1,350.\n\nOf course it won\u2019t be too long before Sears has zero stores, and my regular readers know that I have been talking about the demise of Sears for a very long time.\n\nThe cold, hard truth of the matter is that the \u201creal economy\u201d is a total mess, and that is one of the primary reasons why these ridiculous stock market valuations that we are seeing right now are not sustainable.\n\nOne expert that agrees with my assessment is former Reagan Administration White House Budget Director David Stockman. In a recent interview, he explained why he believes that \u201ceverything will grind to a halt\u201d after March 15th\u2026\n\nStockman, who wrote a book titled \u201cTrumped\u201d predicting a Trump victory in 2016, says, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a snowball\u2019s chance in the hot place that\u2019s going to happen. This is delusional. This is the greatest suckers\u2019 rally of all time. It is based on pure hopium and not any analysis at all as what it will take to push through a big tax cut. Donald Trump is in a trap. Today the debt is $20 trillion. It\u2019s 106% of GDP. . . .Trump is inheriting a built-in deficit of $10 trillion over the next decade under current policies that are built in. Yet, he wants more defense spending, not less. He wants drastic sweeping tax cuts for corporations and individuals. He wants to spend more money on border security and law enforcement. He\u2019s going to do more for the veterans. He wants this big trillion dollar infrastructure program. You put all that together and it\u2019s madness. It doesn\u2019t even begin to add up, and it won\u2019t happen when you are struggling with the $10 trillion of debt that\u2019s coming down the pike and the $20 trillion that\u2019s already on the books.\u201d Then, Stockman drops this bomb and says: \u201cI think what people are missing is this date, March 15th2017. That\u2019s the day that this debt ceiling holiday that Obama and Boehner put together right before the last election in October of 2015. That holiday expires. The debt ceiling will freeze in at $20 trillion. It will then be law. It will be a hard stop. The Treasury will have roughly $200 billion in cash. We are burning cash at a $75 billion a month rate. By summer, they will be out of cash. Then we will be in the mother of all debt ceiling crises. Everything will grind to a halt. I think we will have a government shutdown. There will not be Obama Care repeal and replace. There will be no tax cut. There will be no infrastructure stimulus. There will be just one giant fiscal bloodbath over a debt ceiling that has to be increased and no one wants to vote for.\u201d\n\nIn that same interview, Stockman also predicted that \u201cmarkets will easily correct by 20% and probably a lot more\u201c, and he noted the glaring disconnect between current stock prices and how the U.S. economy is actually performing\u2026\n\n\u201cThe S&P 500 has been trading at 26 times earnings while earnings have been dropping for the past six or seven quarters. There is no booming recovery coming. There is going to be a recession and there will be no stimulus baton to bail it out. That is the new fact that neither Trump nor the Wall Street gamblers remotely understand.\u201d\n\nIt is very difficult to argue with Stockman on this.\n\nThere are some people out there that seem to think that Donald Trump can miraculously turn the U.S. economy around just because he is Donald Trump.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nWe are 20 trillion dollars in debt, and we are currently adding about a trillion dollars a year to that total. There is no possible way that Trump can cut taxes, increase military spending, build a border wall, spend much more on veterans and spend an extra trillion dollars on rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.\n\nWe are flat broke as a nation and there simply is not money available to do everything that Donald Trump wants to do.\n\nSo we shall see what happens after March 15th. Unfortunately, I happen to agree with Stockman that economic reality is about to come knocking and Trump and his supporters are about to get a very rude wake up call.\n\nCourtesy of The Economic Collapse Blog", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=640", "https://i0.wp.com/theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Retail-Apocalypse-2017-Public-Domain-460x308.jpg?resize=460%2C308", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/images/rss/orange-medium.png", "http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Retail-Apocalypse-2017-Public-Domain-460x308.jpg", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg"], "videos": []}
