coming to America very soon. Recently, Julie Whedbee was shown what life will be like for believers in the United States during the Tribulation. She has been having dreams and visions for over 20 years, and she is someone that I have come to hold in high regard. What was revealed to her about the future of the United States is quite chilling to <span id=\"more-70021\"></span>say the least. She was shown a time when Christians have to live in hiding in a post-apocalyptic America where millions of people have already been killed. The following is a short excerpt <a title=\"from what she wrote about this experience\" href=\"https://z3news.com/w/tribulation-people-tribulation-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">from what she wrote about this experience</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were living underground in hiding, in a large but dark abandoned building of some sort. There was no electricity, and had not been for some time. I saw oil lamps and candles everywhere and it was the only light we had. We were all dressed in oversized clothing and head wraps, doing our best to stay as inconspicuous as possible.</p>\n<p>There were times we had to go out for items such as salt, and oil, and would barter with things we had found and collected for this reason. Food was scarce to say the least. Water was also something we were having to look for constantly, and most important for survival.</p>\n<p>As we traveled, we would do so only in the early pre-dawn hours, or at sunset, to do our best to avoid being targeted and taken away to be killed. <strong>I was told by Father this was the United States, after many of the judgments had happened, and He made me to understand that millions had died</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>During this period of time there will be no United States government as we know it today, and Christians will be hunted down and killed like animals. In fact, she says that there will be <a title=\"\u201copen crucifixions in the streets\u201d\" href=\"https://z3news.com/w/tribulation-people-tribulation-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201copen crucifixions in the streets\u201d</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>The streets were very empty, there were only a few small businesses opened, and everything was run by the NWO. Martial law kept everyone in check, and as we traveled, we were watched and controlled by gunpoint. There were certain paths that had to be taken and if we were found traveling any other way, we were shot instantly. We never spoke while outside of our building.</p>\n<p><strong>There were open crucifixions in the streets, a gruesome and horrible sight, of anyone who publicly confessed Christianity</strong>. The bodies, once dead, were then left where they hung. Christianity was long gone in this country. Our group did the best we could to go at night and take the bodies of these precious souls back to where we were hiding, although we had no way to properly bury them. I saw rows of them on a far wall of our hiding place, wrapped in sheets and blankets as this was all we had. I remember discussing with the others what we were going to do with these martyrs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you would like to read the entire thing, you can find the original <a title=\"right here\" href=\"http://iamcallingyounow.blogspot.com/2017/02/i-saw-tribulation-tell-my-people.html\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course Julie Whedbee is certainly not the only one that has been shown the future of America. Hundreds of others have also been warned that judgment is rapidly approaching. For example, the following is what Glynda Lomax <a title=\"was recently shown\" href=\"https://z3news.com/w/true-children-shine-beacon-dark-time/\" target=\"_blank\">was recently shown</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cMuch strife and confusion is coming to the earth. There will be eruptions of violence, murder, strife and infighting in various places.</p>\n<p>Much tension shall abound, and brother shall strike out at brother. The line is being drawn tight.</p>\n<p>(NOTE: In the spirit here, I saw a line, like a tightrope wire, being tightened and tightened, until it looked like it would just snap from the tension.)</p>\n<p>When I speak to the angels, what is holding back the war will be released, and battles will break out in many places. War will break out. Fighting and killing will seem to be everywhere at once. <strong>This is the beginning of the end</strong>. Prepare your houses. Prepare your hearts, for the end is upon you. The end of all things quickly approaches.</p>\n<p>My children in the earth, My true children, will shine like a beacon in this dark time. Miracles will abound, My Word will go forth with great boldness and authority as it did in the time My Son Jesus walked the earth, and many souls will be added unto My Kingdom. <strong>The end is very near now as these souls enter just before the door is shut</strong>.</p>\n<p>Prepare your houses. Prepare your hearts, for the end is upon you.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sadly, the vast majority of the population refuses to listen to the warnings.</p>\n<p>As a nation we need to repent and turn from our wicked ways, but that is simply not happening. Instead, just about every type of evil that you can possibly imagine is exploding in our society.</p>\n<p>For example, earlier today I ran across a <a title=\"CNN article\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/02/health/nursing-home-sex-abuse-investigation/?iid=ob_homepage_deskrecommended_pool\" target=\"_blank\">CNN article</a> that talked about the epidemic of sexual assault that is taking place in America\u2019s nursing homes\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>The unthinkable is happening at facilities throughout the country: Vulnerable seniors are being <strong>raped</strong> and <strong>sexually abused</strong> by the very people paid to care for them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to know just how many victims are out there. But through an exclusive analysis of state and federal data and interviews with experts, regulators and the families of victims, CNN has found that this little-discussed issue is <strong>more widespread than anyone would imagine</strong>.</p>\n<p>Even more disturbing: In many cases, nursing homes and the government officials who oversee them are <strong>doing little \u2014 or nothing \u2014 to stop it</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you read that entire CNN article you may want to vomit by the time you get to the end of it.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>And even our \u201cChristian\u201d leaders are involved in some of the most horrific things imaginable. If you can believe it, <a title=\"WND is reporting\" href=\"http://www.wnd.com/2017/02/graham-planned-parenthood-fundraiser-akin-to-funding-nazi-death-camp/\" target=\"_blank\">WND is reporting</a> that George W. Bush\u2019s daughter Barbara is going to be the keynote speaker at a Planned Parenthood fundraiser\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>Franklin Graham, the president and CEO of the humanitarian aid mission Samaritan\u2019s Purse and one of the world\u2019s best-known Christian leaders, <strong>slammed an upcoming Planned Parenthood fundraiser that will be keynoted by former president George W. Bush\u2019s daughter, Barbara, as akin to raising money for the Nazis during World War II</strong>.</p>\n<p>In a Facebook post, Graham wrote: \u201cPlanned Parenthood is the #1 abortion provider in the United States. Raising funds for this organization is like raising money to fund a Nazi death camp\u2014like Auschwitz, except for innocent babies in their mother\u2019s wombs! Reports say they perform over 300,000 abortions per year. And this is the organization whose employees were caught on video trying to sell baby body parts over wine. Disgusting.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I could go on and on all day, but one more thing that I want to mention is our national addiction to pornography.</p>\n<p>As I have discussed <a title=\"previously\" href=\"http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/during-the-trump-era-will-men-finally-start-acting-like-men-again\" target=\"_blank\">previously</a>, one major survey discovered that <a title=\"64 percent\" href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/study-more-than-half-of-christian-men-look-at-porn-at-least-once-a-month\" target=\"_blank\">64 percent</a> of all <strong>Christian</strong> men in the United States look at \u201cadult material\u201d at least once a month, and another major survey discovered that <a title=\"68 percent\" href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/sponsored-content/56025-men-around-the-world-are-giving-up-porn-and-it-s-because-of-this\" target=\"_blank\">68 percent</a> of all <strong>Christian</strong> men in the United States look at \u201cadult material\u201d on a \u201cregular basis\u201d.</p>\n<p>Those numbers alone would explain why the institutional church in America is deader than a doornail right now.</p>\n<p>And I was absolutely astounded when I learned that in just one year <a title=\"more than 87 billion videos\" href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/pornhub-just-released-their-2015-statistics.-and-its-sickening\" target=\"_blank\">more than 87 billion videos</a> were watched on one adult website alone.</p>\n<p>It does not take a genius to figure out why judgment is coming to America, and it is going to start with the church. Judgment begins with the house of God, and I want to share with you a portion of what Marty Breeden recently had to share <a title=\"on Facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marty.steinberger.9/posts/781368275344054\" target=\"_blank\">on Facebook</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>I\u2019ve had this STRONG sense over the the last few days, that the Lord is about to send, to and through His servants a message of Repentance first to the church and then to the lost world.</p>\n<p>NOT ALL churches and Pastors will reject that message, but MOST will and those who deliver that message will NOT be welcomed to the vast majority of American pulpits.</p>\n<p><strong>These servants will burn with the Fire of the Living God in their hearts and they will not succumb to church politics or pressures from politically correct pastors.</strong></p>\n<p>Many of these fire-branded MEN AND WOMEN will circumvent the \u201cchurch as normal\u201d to deliver this message and <strong>they WILL NOT be stopped!</strong> They will not be popular or wealthy but they will be powerful, not of their own strength either, but it will be the undeniable power of God.</p>\n<p>The Gospel will go forth with great power and influence and be confirmed as it was in the Book of Acts, with signs, wonders and mighty miracles. The people of the church will then have to determine if they are going to still be part of a dry, dead social club atmosphere, or are they going to seek the face of God and impact and change their world and the generation they were destined to influence.</p>\n<p>We often speak of the \u201cComing Judgment\u201d and it is coming indeed, but we often leave out the part that \u201cJudgment MUST begin at the \u201cHouse of God\u201d (1 Peter 4:17)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sadly, the institutional church doesn\u2019t want to hear voices such as this, and instead they are exalting people that speak endlessly of prosperity.</p>\n<p>But the Word of God has a warning about those that only speak of prosperity. The following is what Jeremiah 28:7-9 says <a title=\"in the Modern English Version\" href=\"http://amzn.to/2linn6q\" target=\"_blank\">in the Modern English Version</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cNevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your ears and in the ears of all the people. 8 The prophets of old who have been before me and before you prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms, of war and disaster and pestilence. 9 As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet shall be known as one whom the Lord has truly sent.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>A great shaking is coming, and this is going to include a great shaking of the institutional church.</p>\n<p>But we should be thankful for the shaking that is coming, because multitudes will be shaken into the Kingdom of God, and an immense wave of glory will be unleashed all over the world.</p>\n<p><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/what-this-woman-was-shown-about-the-future-of-the-united-states-will-shake-you-to-your-core\" target=\"_blank\">End of the American Dream</a></em></p>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Don't forget to follow the D.C.

I believe that now, America has the potential, if the people are willing, to shed some of the distractions and oppression that the last 8 years have laid upon us.   I believe that with fewer negative distractions, the unbeliever may be more amenable to hearing the Word of God, receiving it, and believing it.</p>\n<p>I also know that this is just for a time.  America will not stand forever, as much as I&#8217;d like it to, and death blows have rained upon it already, but God, Who is merciful beyond my capacity to understand it, has given us Christians a window in which to work.  But time is short, and we speak the Word only when we believe it.</p>\n<p>I partly agree with Robert Johnson [post below mine] on the TIMELINE of things.  But there will be believers even after we are gone.  They will not be saved by grace as we are, because the administration of grace ends when we leave.  They will believe, but they will pay with their lives.   God will avenge them at the time of judgment.</p>\n<p>This is not hard to understand.   He would have all men to be saved, and even when the darkness is great, His Light is greater.  When we are gone, those that are left behind are going to remember our words, and they will seek to find out more about what we told them.</p>\n<p>Until then, we MUST speak God&#8217;s Word to a world that so desperately needs it.  Right up to the moment the trumpet sounds.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-22840\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-22840\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-22840\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-22840\">Robert Johnson</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-22840\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-22840\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>America will go through a horrific time. But Christians will not be here. Romans 5:9, 1 Thessalonians 1:10 and 5:9 tell us Jesus delivers us from the wrath to come. the wrath that Revelations chapters 8-19 describe. 1 Thessalonians 1:10 says we are waiting for Jesus from heaven Who delivers us from the wrath to come. America will suffer. the people who are here at that time received not the love of the truth to be saved so they were left behind and not taken by Jesus at His second coming. Deliverance from those days for the believer is our hope and why we live a life of faith to be counted worthy to escape all the things that are coming upon this earth (Luke 21:36   36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.) She says, \u201c\u2026I was told by Father,\u201d Christians will be hunted down and killed. I can say with confidence The Father didn\u2019t tell her that. The description of a horrific time in this country is accurate. The people here may be religious, but they didn\u2019t practice the faith according to the sayings of Jesus.  They didn\u2019t listen to Jesus\u2019 command to enter the straight gate and the narrow way.  They weren\u2019t Christians in the true sense of the word, which means imitators of Christ.   So either this woman has received something from God and then blended in her own ideas based upon her biblical ignorance into it, or this has come from a seducing spirit, that undermines the hope of the believer, even as people in the days of the apostle Paul were trying to do which was an important issue Paul addressed in his two letters to the Church of Thessalonica.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-22820\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-22820\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-22820\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-22820\">Lakshmima</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-22820\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-22820\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Oh boooo, I&#8217;m scared.

These passages describe the same event a coming of Jesus where he stays in the air, does not touch the Ground unlike the Glorious Appearing at the end of the Tribulation Period!!  I believe if these are true visions they are visions of the time during the last 31/2 years of the Tribulation when the anti-Christ desecrates the Temple and begins his slaughter of the Jews and the Christians that become Christian after the Rapture!!  Just imagine the grief, fear and heartbroken sense that is on the earth after the rapture takes place and all the children, innocents and Believers are instantly GONE!!

Recently, Julie Whedbee was shown what life will be like for believers in the United States during the Tribulation. She has been having dreams and visions for over 20 years, and she is someone that I have come to hold in high regard. What was revealed to her about the future of the United States is quite chilling to say the least. She was shown a time when Christians have to live in hiding in a post-apocalyptic America where millions of people have already been killed. The following is a short excerpt from what she wrote about this experience\u2026\n\nWe were living underground in hiding, in a large but dark abandoned building of some sort. There was no electricity, and had not been for some time. I saw oil lamps and candles everywhere and it was the only light we had. We were all dressed in oversized clothing and head wraps, doing our best to stay as inconspicuous as possible. There were times we had to go out for items such as salt, and oil, and would barter with things we had found and collected for this reason. Food was scarce to say the least. Water was also something we were having to look for constantly, and most important for survival. As we traveled, we would do so only in the early pre-dawn hours, or at sunset, to do our best to avoid being targeted and taken away to be killed. I was told by Father this was the United States, after many of the judgments had happened, and He made me to understand that millions had died.\n\nDuring this period of time there will be no United States government as we know it today, and Christians will be hunted down and killed like animals. In fact, she says that there will be \u201copen crucifixions in the streets\u201d\u2026\n\nThe streets were very empty, there were only a few small businesses opened, and everything was run by the NWO. Martial law kept everyone in check, and as we traveled, we were watched and controlled by gunpoint. There were certain paths that had to be taken and if we were found traveling any other way, we were shot instantly. We never spoke while outside of our building. There were open crucifixions in the streets, a gruesome and horrible sight, of anyone who publicly confessed Christianity. The bodies, once dead, were then left where they hung. Christianity was long gone in this country. Our group did the best we could to go at night and take the bodies of these precious souls back to where we were hiding, although we had no way to properly bury them. I saw rows of them on a far wall of our hiding place, wrapped in sheets and blankets as this was all we had. I remember discussing with the others what we were going to do with these martyrs.\n\nIf you would like to read the entire thing, you can find the original right here.\n\nOf course Julie Whedbee is certainly not the only one that has been shown the future of America. Hundreds of others have also been warned that judgment is rapidly approaching. For example, the following is what Glynda Lomax was recently shown\u2026\n\n\u201cMuch strife and confusion is coming to the earth. There will be eruptions of violence, murder, strife and infighting in various places. Much tension shall abound, and brother shall strike out at brother. The line is being drawn tight. (NOTE: In the spirit here, I saw a line, like a tightrope wire, being tightened and tightened, until it looked like it would just snap from the tension.) When I speak to the angels, what is holding back the war will be released, and battles will break out in many places. War will break out. Fighting and killing will seem to be everywhere at once. This is the beginning of the end. Prepare your houses. Prepare your hearts, for the end is upon you. The end of all things quickly approaches. My children in the earth, My true children, will shine like a beacon in this dark time. Miracles will abound, My Word will go forth with great boldness and authority as it did in the time My Son Jesus walked the earth, and many souls will be added unto My Kingdom. The end is very near now as these souls enter just before the door is shut. Prepare your houses. Prepare your hearts, for the end is upon you.\u201d\n\nSadly, the vast majority of the population refuses to listen to the warnings.\n\nAs a nation we need to repent and turn from our wicked ways, but that is simply not happening. Instead, just about every type of evil that you can possibly imagine is exploding in our society.\n\nFor example, earlier today I ran across a CNN article that talked about the epidemic of sexual assault that is taking place in America\u2019s nursing homes\u2026\n\nThe unthinkable is happening at facilities throughout the country: Vulnerable seniors are being raped and sexually abused by the very people paid to care for them. It\u2019s impossible to know just how many victims are out there. But through an exclusive analysis of state and federal data and interviews with experts, regulators and the families of victims, CNN has found that this little-discussed issue is more widespread than anyone would imagine. Even more disturbing: In many cases, nursing homes and the government officials who oversee them are doing little \u2014 or nothing \u2014 to stop it.\n\nIf you read that entire CNN article you may want to vomit by the time you get to the end of it.\n\nAnd even our \u201cChristian\u201d leaders are involved in some of the most horrific things imaginable. If you can believe it, WND is reporting that George W. Bush\u2019s daughter Barbara is going to be the keynote speaker at a Planned Parenthood fundraiser\u2026\n\nFranklin Graham, the president and CEO of the humanitarian aid mission Samaritan\u2019s Purse and one of the world\u2019s best-known Christian leaders, slammed an upcoming Planned Parenthood fundraiser that will be keynoted by former president George W. Bush\u2019s daughter, Barbara, as akin to raising money for the Nazis during World War II. In a Facebook post, Graham wrote: \u201cPlanned Parenthood is the #1 abortion provider in the United States. Raising funds for this organization is like raising money to fund a Nazi death camp\u2014like Auschwitz, except for innocent babies in their mother\u2019s wombs! Reports say they perform over 300,000 abortions per year. And this is the organization whose employees were caught on video trying to sell baby body parts over wine. Disgusting.\u201d\n\nI could go on and on all day, but one more thing that I want to mention is our national addiction to pornography.\n\nAs I have discussed previously, one major survey discovered that 64 percent of all Christian men in the United States look at \u201cadult material\u201d at least once a month, and another major survey discovered that 68 percent of all Christian men in the United States look at \u201cadult material\u201d on a \u201cregular basis\u201d.\n\nThose numbers alone would explain why the institutional church in America is deader than a doornail right now.\n\nAnd I was absolutely astounded when I learned that in just one year more than 87 billion videos were watched on one adult website alone.\n\nIt does not take a genius to figure out why judgment is coming to America, and it is going to start with the church. Judgment begins with the house of God, and I want to share with you a portion of what Marty Breeden recently had to share on Facebook\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve had this STRONG sense over the the last few days, that the Lord is about to send, to and through His servants a message of Repentance first to the church and then to the lost world. NOT ALL churches and Pastors will reject that message, but MOST will and those who deliver that message will NOT be welcomed to the vast majority of American pulpits. These servants will burn with the Fire of the Living God in their hearts and they will not succumb to church politics or pressures from politically correct pastors. Many of these fire-branded MEN AND WOMEN will circumvent the \u201cchurch as normal\u201d to deliver this message and they WILL NOT be stopped! They will not be popular or wealthy but they will be powerful, not of their own strength either, but it will be the undeniable power of God. The Gospel will go forth with great power and influence and be confirmed as it was in the Book of Acts, with signs, wonders and mighty miracles. The people of the church will then have to determine if they are going to still be part of a dry, dead social club atmosphere, or are they going to seek the face of God and impact and change their world and the generation they were destined to influence. We often speak of the \u201cComing Judgment\u201d and it is coming indeed, but we often leave out the part that \u201cJudgment MUST begin at the \u201cHouse of God\u201d (1 Peter 4:17)\n\nSadly, the institutional church doesn\u2019t want to hear voices such as this, and instead they are exalting people that speak endlessly of prosperity.\n\nBut the Word of God has a warning about those that only speak of prosperity. The following is what Jeremiah 28:7-9 says in the Modern English Version\u2026\n\n\u201cNevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your ears and in the ears of all the people. 8 The prophets of old who have been before me and before you prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms, of war and disaster and pestilence. 9 As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet shall be known as one whom the Lord has truly sent.\u201d\n\nA great shaking is coming, and this is going to include a great shaking of the institutional church.\n\nBut we should be thankful for the shaking that is coming, because multitudes will be shaken into the Kingdom of God, and an immense wave of glory will be unleashed all over the world.\n\nCourtesy of End of the American Dream", "images": ["http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Apocalyptic-City-Skyline-Public-Domain-460x325.jpg?resize=460%2C325", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Apocalyptic-City-Skyline-Public-Domain-460x325.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=640", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/images/rss/orange-medium.png"], "videos": []}
