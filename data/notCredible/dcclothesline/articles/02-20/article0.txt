Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us.</p>\n<p>\u2018Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you have not seen footage of this incredible moment yet, you can watch it <a title=\"right here\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOz3yD-wtwg\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>\u2026</p>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOz3yD-wtwg\" width=\"496\" height=\"279\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></center>One of the primary reasons why this moment evoked so much emotion is because the Lord\u2019s Prayer is undeniably a Christian prayer.</p>\n<p>Over the decades, our politicians have become very adept at speaking of \u201cgod\u201d in a very generic sense.\u00a0 Even when they pray, most of our politicians are careful to use universal language that could apply to almost any religion.</p>\n<p>That is why what Melania Trump did was so radical.\u00a0 By reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer, she was clearly identifying herself as a Christian, and there was absolutely no question about who she was addressing.</p>\n<p>It was such a simple prayer, but needless to say it sent liberals <a title=\"into a social media frenzy\" href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/19/melania-trump-opens-florida-rally-with-the-lords-prayer-then-liberals-atheists-bash-her-for-it/\" target=\"_blank\">into a social media frenzy</a>.\u00a0 They started calling her every name in the book and used some of the most foul language imaginable.</p>\n<p>Some of the more moderate liberals objected to the prayer on the basis of separation of church and state, but nowhere in the Constitution does it say that our elected officials cannot be Christian.\u00a0 And nowhere in the Constitution does it say that they cannot speak on matters of faith.</p>\n<p>In fact, if we are to have any hope of turning this nation around we desperately need the favor of God, and that is why what Melania Trump did was so important.</p>\n<p>In her prayer, she asked for God\u2019s will to be done on Earth just as it is done in heaven.</p>\n<p>If we truly were to follow that course, there would be no limits to what we could achieve as a people.</p>\n<p>But in order for that to happen, we must completely change direction as a nation, and Melania\u2019s prayer was also a prayer of repentance.</p>\n<p>The phrase \u201cforgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us\u201d was not a perfect quotation of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, but it was immensely powerful.</p>\n<p>By asking for forgiveness, that implies that we have done things that we need to be forgiven for.\u00a0 And without a doubt, that list is very long.\u00a0 We have killed tens of millions of babies since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, we produce more pornography than the rest of the world combined, sexual immorality of every kind you can imagine is running rampant in our society, our entertainment <a title=\"is mostly pure filth\" href=\"http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/we-live-in-a-society-where-fifty-shades-beyonce-and-lady-gaga-are-considered-to-be-entertainment\" target=\"_blank\">is mostly pure filth</a>, and we have pushed God and His ways out of almost every corner of public life.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>If we want to get on the right track as a country, one of the very first things that should be done is to <a title=\"defund Planned Parenthood\" href=\"http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/planned-parenthood-workers-that-reached-abortion-sales-quota-goals-were-rewarded-with-pizza-parties\">defund Planned Parenthood</a>.\u00a0 The Republicans finally have control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, and so there are no more excuses.</p>\n<p>If Donald Trump and the Republicans truly are \u201cpro-life\u201d, Planned Parenthood will be defunded in 2017.</p>\n<p>But if it doesn\u2019t happen, then they will share in the accountability for the Great American Holocaust, and the blood of every baby that is murdered from now on will be on their hands.</p>\n<p>That is why this is one of the most important moments in American history.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t turn around now, I don\u2019t think that we ever will, and choosing to go down the same path that we are currently on <a title=\"will only lead us to judgment\" href=\"http://amzn.to/2mdtdqU\" target=\"_blank\">will only lead us to judgment</a>.</p>\n<p>So that is why I was so thrilled with Melania\u2019s prayer.\u00a0 By boldly identifying themselves as Christians, the Trumps are giving those of us that also consider ourselves to be Christians hope that a new day is ahead.</p>\n<p>But it can\u2019t just be words.\u00a0 That is why what happens over the next few months is so incredibly important.</p>\n<p>And of course the radical left is going to fight Donald Trump and his team every step of the way.\u00a0 About a week ago, I wrote about the army of <a title=\"more than 30,000 activists\" href=\"http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/sabotage-obama-is-commanding-an-army-of-30000-anti-trump-activists-from-his-home-2-miles-from-the-white-house\" target=\"_blank\">more than 30,000 activists</a> that Barack Obama is commanding from his new home less than two miles away from the White House.\u00a0 Well, now we have learned that Organizing for Action is going to be working with a network of other radical groups <a title=\"to disrupt town hall meetings all over the nation\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4239870/Anti-Trump-activists-invade-Congressional-town-halls.html\" target=\"_blank\">to disrupt town hall meetings all over the nation</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>Progressive activists continue to take a cue from the Tea Party movement with plans to funnel into town hall meetings this week while members of Congress are at home and make a ruckus.</p>\n<p>Groups, including President Barack Obama\u2019s Organizing for Action, are turning to a newer organization, Indivisible Guide, to coordinate tactics.</p>\n<p>Launched in December by former Congressional staffers, Indivisible is providing activists with training manuals, such as one that explains how to have a \u2018successful\u2019 town hall.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The progressives hate Trump and they want to keep this nation going down the exact same road that we were heading under Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>We are literally in a battle for the future of America, and the outcome is still to be determined.</p>\n<p>But what Melania Trump did when she stepped behind that podium was a major step in the right direction, and hopefully we will be seeing much more of that from her and Donald in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/why-melania-trump-leading-the-public-in-the-lords-prayer-at-a-rally-in-florida-was-a-historic-event\" target=\"_blank\">The Economic Collapse Blog</a></em></p>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Don't forget to follow the D.C.

They are all beautiful.  Our 45th POTUS maintains his tase for<br />\nbeauty, similar to how he maintains his taste to fulfill the promises he imparted during<br />\nthe campaign.  It is a statement that this worthless Black turd of a POS of a token<br />\nTar-Baby of a former ex-POTUS and his ugly wife could never hope to fulfill, if we patriotic  Americans remember the worthless words that emanated from her worthless mouth, that:  &#8220;I WAS NEVER PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN, UNTIL HER/HIS HUSBAND WAS ELECTED POTUS.&#8221;  Not only is she to be considered the worst of the Black community, but she is also a grifter similar to her worthless Mulatto Husband.  Remember how this worthless Black turd of an ex-44 POTUS, promised to change the United States, through himself and Hillary Rotten Clinton as his protege, but they never quite made the grade to fulfill those promises, either.  But, our 45th POTUS and his wife, are well on their way to fulfill ALL of his promises, provided that this worthless Black turd of an ex-44th POTUS keeps his worthless Kenyan mouth shut, and that Chuckie &#8220;BOY&#8221; Schumer is eventually impeached.  Schumer is a snake.  He cares nothing for the American people.  What he does care about, is to grant permission to all of his Muslim turds, to enter the United States to be used as future, Democrat voters.  While Mrs. Trump represents the freshness of our American youth and our<br />\nAmerican Constitution, how did Mooch and Hillary Rotten Clinton conspire to bring<br />\nthe United States to her knees, along with the worthless Black turd of a 44th POTUS<br />\nand his girlfriend, George &#8220;NAZI&#8221; Soros, Valerie Jarrett, and Nancy Pelosi.  Notice<br />\ntoo, all of these Communist turds that I imparted, are wealthy beyond most American&#8217;s<br />\ndreams, but I have let to become privy to any of their benevolences, while at the<br />\nsame time, our 45 POTUS maintains a list of his philanthropy that he desires not to<br />\nmake public, in a sense, similar to Frank Sinatra.  Most Americans are also not aware<br />\nof what Frank Sinatra did for his fellow Americans.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-22111\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-22111\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-22111\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-22111\">clarioncaller</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-22111\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-22111\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>A long-awaited &#8216;class act&#8217;.

Granted, what our 45th POTUS&#8217;s wife accomplished, was highly commendable, but what we are perhaps forgetting, is that<br />\nthe U.S. maintains a battle with the Democrat Party and the worthless Muslims.  Therefore, permit we patriotic Americans to declare &#8220;TOTAL WAR&#8221; on both entities mentioned above, to include getting rid of this worthless, former Black turd of a 44th POTUS, his Girl-friend, George &#8220;NAZI&#8221; Soros, Hillary Rotten Clinton and Valerie Jarrett, all of which are effn Communists or worse.  It is without a doubt that our 45th POTUS was sent to us by our Creator, similar to how David was sent to defeat Goliath by our Creator.  Can anyone imagine, had Hillary Rotten Clinton been elected POTUS, that we would have had to put up with her ugly face for at least another 4 years, unless she suddenly dropped dead, similar to some of her associates.  Then there is another Mrs. Ugly, the Mooch and her/his Blackness.  The same Black turd that imparted during this worthless Black turd&#8217;s first term, that she/he was never proud of the United States, until this worthless Black turd was elected/selected someone&#8217;s 44th POTUS, for surely, he/she was not my 44th POTUS.  Currently, it is a pleasure to view our 45th POTUS&#8217;s wife&#8217;s countenance, each time she addresses the American public, and not because she maintains Hollywood beauty, but because what she has to impart to the American public, is meaningful, spoken exactly how she feels about her adopted country.  Of course, with the likes of Hillary Rotten Clinton and Black Mouch, there was never any words of wisdom of how much either of these two turds, loved the United States.  Never!!  Their ownly desire as wives of the POTUS, was the power and prestige that he represented.  And then too, what have been the<br />\naccomplishments of Hillary Rotten Clinton and the Black Mooch?  Can either them<br />\nspeak more than one language? No!!  Have either of them accomplished a profession<br />\non their own, that can be attributed to their own talents? No!!  Our 45th POTUS&#8217;s<br />\nwife, not only speaks 5 languages, but she was a highly sought model when she was<br />\nyounger.  Hillary Rotten Clinton was the worst Secretary of State that the United<br />\nStates has hired, another mistake attributed to the Black, 44th POTUS, while both<br />\nof Hillary Rotten Clinton was fired from her position at Watergate in 1972 or in 1973,<br />\nwhile the Black Mooch and her worthless Black 44th POTUS, have been had their<br />\nlawyer&#8217;s licenses, garnished.  Hopefully, with the election of our 45th POTUS, both he<br />\nand his Attorney General, will attribute the blame to where the blame should be<br />\ndirected in the felonies committed with this worthless Black 44th POTUS, and his<br />\nworthless Communist Secretary of State, Hillary Rotten Clinton, whom was the lover<br />\nof Saul Alinsky, another Communist whom wrote the book, &#8220;RULES FOR RADICALS,&#8221;<br />\na book that is predicated on how to bring any country its knees.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-22044\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-22044\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-22044\">\n                <a id=\"dsq-author-user-22044\" href=\"http://www.bibleversusconstitution.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ted R.

After a week in which her husband declared war on the mainstream media, Melania absolutely electrified a huge crowd at a rally in Melbourne, Florida by reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer. What Donald Trump had to share afterwards was remarkable as well, but that night will always be remembered for what Melania did. After beginning with the phrase \u201clet us pray\u201d, Melania stunned the entire world by slowly but carefully leading the crowd in the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and it is being reported that the assembled throng responded to her prayer with \u201cthunderous applause\u201c.\n\nShe did not pronounce all of the words perfectly, but that didn\u2019t matter.\n\nWhat matters is that her courage enabled her to create the most powerful moment that we have seen from a First Lady in decades. The following is from a transcript of her remarks\u2026\n\nOur Father who art in heaven, hallowed is your name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us. \u2018Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen.\n\nIf you have not seen footage of this incredible moment yet, you can watch it right here\u2026\n\nOne of the primary reasons why this moment evoked so much emotion is because the Lord\u2019s Prayer is undeniably a Christian prayer.\n\nOver the decades, our politicians have become very adept at speaking of \u201cgod\u201d in a very generic sense. Even when they pray, most of our politicians are careful to use universal language that could apply to almost any religion.\n\nThat is why what Melania Trump did was so radical. By reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer, she was clearly identifying herself as a Christian, and there was absolutely no question about who she was addressing.\n\nIt was such a simple prayer, but needless to say it sent liberals into a social media frenzy. They started calling her every name in the book and used some of the most foul language imaginable.\n\nSome of the more moderate liberals objected to the prayer on the basis of separation of church and state, but nowhere in the Constitution does it say that our elected officials cannot be Christian. And nowhere in the Constitution does it say that they cannot speak on matters of faith.\n\nIn fact, if we are to have any hope of turning this nation around we desperately need the favor of God, and that is why what Melania Trump did was so important.\n\nIn her prayer, she asked for God\u2019s will to be done on Earth just as it is done in heaven.\n\nIf we truly were to follow that course, there would be no limits to what we could achieve as a people.\n\nBut in order for that to happen, we must completely change direction as a nation, and Melania\u2019s prayer was also a prayer of repentance.\n\nThe phrase \u201cforgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us\u201d was not a perfect quotation of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, but it was immensely powerful.\n\nBy asking for forgiveness, that implies that we have done things that we need to be forgiven for. And without a doubt, that list is very long. We have killed tens of millions of babies since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, we produce more pornography than the rest of the world combined, sexual immorality of every kind you can imagine is running rampant in our society, our entertainment is mostly pure filth, and we have pushed God and His ways out of almost every corner of public life.\n\nIf we want to get on the right track as a country, one of the very first things that should be done is to defund Planned Parenthood. The Republicans finally have control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, and so there are no more excuses.\n\nIf Donald Trump and the Republicans truly are \u201cpro-life\u201d, Planned Parenthood will be defunded in 2017.\n\nBut if it doesn\u2019t happen, then they will share in the accountability for the Great American Holocaust, and the blood of every baby that is murdered from now on will be on their hands.\n\nThat is why this is one of the most important moments in American history. If we don\u2019t turn around now, I don\u2019t think that we ever will, and choosing to go down the same path that we are currently on will only lead us to judgment.\n\nSo that is why I was so thrilled with Melania\u2019s prayer. By boldly identifying themselves as Christians, the Trumps are giving those of us that also consider ourselves to be Christians hope that a new day is ahead.\n\nBut it can\u2019t just be words. That is why what happens over the next few months is so incredibly important.\n\nAnd of course the radical left is going to fight Donald Trump and his team every step of the way. About a week ago, I wrote about the army of more than 30,000 activists that Barack Obama is commanding from his new home less than two miles away from the White House. Well, now we have learned that Organizing for Action is going to be working with a network of other radical groups to disrupt town hall meetings all over the nation\u2026\n\nProgressive activists continue to take a cue from the Tea Party movement with plans to funnel into town hall meetings this week while members of Congress are at home and make a ruckus. Groups, including President Barack Obama\u2019s Organizing for Action, are turning to a newer organization, Indivisible Guide, to coordinate tactics. Launched in December by former Congressional staffers, Indivisible is providing activists with training manuals, such as one that explains how to have a \u2018successful\u2019 town hall.\n\nThe progressives hate Trump and they want to keep this nation going down the exact same road that we were heading under Barack Obama.\n\nWe are literally in a battle for the future of America, and the outcome is still to be determined.\n\nBut what Melania Trump did when she stepped behind that podium was a major step in the right direction, and hopefully we will be seeing much more of that from her and Donald in the future.\n\nCourtesy of The Economic Collapse Blog", "images": ["http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=640", "http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Melania-Trump-Prayer-At-Florida-Rally-YouTube-Screenshot-460x259.jpg", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/images/rss/orange-medium.png", "https://i2.wp.com/theeconomiccollapseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Melania-Trump-Prayer-At-Florida-Rally-YouTube-Screenshot-460x259.jpg?resize=460%2C259"], "videos": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOz3yD-wtwg"]}
