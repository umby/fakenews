Men who can determine financial and banking policy? Men who can set up corporate tribunals that nullify national courts? Men who can set virtually any national policy agenda they want to?</p>\n<p>If an honest press existed, all this would be out in the open by now.</p>\n<p>If, as many people are now saying, the CIA and NSA and neocons are the unelected Deep State, then the people I\u2019m talking about would be the Deep, Deep State.</p>\n<p>Read on.</p>\n<p>Many people think the Trilateral Commission (TC), created in 1973 by David Rockefeller, is a relic of an older time.</p>\n<p>Think again.</p>\n<p>Patrick Wood, author of Trilaterals Over Washington, points out there are only 87 members of the Trilateral Commission who live in America. Obama appointed eleven of them to posts in his administration.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the original stated goal of the TC was to create \u201ca new international economic order.\u201d Knowing that you have to break eggs to make an omelet, consider how the following TC members, in key Obama posts, could have helped engender further national chaos; erase our sovereign national borders; and install binding international agreements that will envelop our economy and money in a deeper global collective: a new world order:</p>\n<p>Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary;</p>\n<p>James Jones, National Security Advisor;</p>\n<p>Paul Volker, Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee;</p>\n<p>Dennis Blair, Director of National Intelligence.</p>\n<p>All Trilateralists.</p>\n<p>In the run-up to his inauguration after the 2008 presidential election, Obama was tutored by the co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, <a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2015/10/08/brzezinski-calls-for-retaliation-against-russia-for-fighting-isis/\" target=\"_blank\">Zbigniew Brzezinski</a>.</p>\n<p>In Europe, the financially embattled nations of Greece and Italy brought in Lucas Papademos and Mario Monti as prime ministers. Both men are Trilateral members, and Monti is the former European chairman of the Trilateral Commission.</p>\n<p>In the US, since 1973, author Wood counts eight out of 10 US Trade Representative appointments, and six out of eight World Bank presidents, as American Trilateral members.</p>\n<p>Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote, four years before birthing the TC in 1973, with his godfather, David Rockefeller: \u201c[The] nation state as a fundamental unit of man\u2019s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force. International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state.\u201d</p>\n<p>Several other noteworthy Trilateral members: George HW Bush; Bill Clinton; Dick Cheney; Al Gore. The first three men helped sink the US further into debt by fomenting wars abroad; and Gore\u2019s cap and trade blueprint would destroy industrial economies, while vastly increasing the numbers of people in Third World countries who have no access to modern sources of energy.</p>\n<p>Does all this offer a clue as to why the US economy has failed to recover from the Wall Street debacle of 2008, why the federal bailout was a handout to super-rich criminals, and why Obama took no actions which would have brought about an authentic recovery?</p>\n<p>A closer look at Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner\u2019s circle of economic advisers reveals the chilling Trilateral effect: Paul Volker; Alan Greenspan; E. Gerald Corrigan (director, Goldman Sachs); and Peter G Peterson (former CEO, Lehman Brothers, former chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations). These men are all Trilateral members.</p>\n<p>How many foxes in the hen house do we need, before we realize their Trilateral agenda is controlling the direction of our economy?</p>\n<p>The TC has no interest in building up the American economy. They want to torpedo it, as part of the end-game of creating a de facto Globalist management system for the whole planet.</p>\n<p>Any doubt on the question of TC goals is answered by David Rockefeller himself, the founder of the TC, in his Memoirs (2003): \u201cSome even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as \u2018internationalists\u2019 and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure\u2014one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even in what many people mistakenly think of as the TC\u2019s heyday, the 1970s, there were few who realized its overarching power.</p>\n<p>Here is a close-up snap shot of a remarkable moment from out of the past. It\u2019s a through-the-looking-glass secret\u2014in the form of a conversation between a reporter, Jeremiah Novak, and two Trilateral Commission members, Karl Kaiser and Richard Cooper. The interview took place in 1978. It concerned the issue of who exactly, during President Carter\u2019s administration, was formulating US economic and political policy.</p>\n<p>The careless and off-hand attitude of Trilateralists Kaiser and Cooper is astonishing. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re saying, \u201cWhat we\u2019re revealing is already out in the open, it\u2019s too late to do anything about it, why are you so worked up, we\u2019ve already won\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>NOVAK (the reporter): Is it true that a private [Trilateral committee] led by Henry Owen of the US and made up of [Trilateral] representatives of the US, UK, West Germany, Japan, France and the EEC is coordinating the economic and political policies of the Trilateral countries [which would include the US]?</p>\n<p>COOPER: Yes, they have met three times.</p>\n<p>NOVAK: Yet, in your recent paper you state that this committee should remain informal because to formalize \u2018this function might well prove offensive to some of the Trilateral and other countries which do not take part.\u2019 Who are you afraid of?</p>\n<p>KAISER: Many countries in Europe would resent the dominant role that West Germany plays at these [Trilateral] meetings.</p>\n<p>COOPER: Many people still live in a world of separate nations, and they would resent such coordination [of policy].</p>\n<p>NOVAK: But this [Trilateral] committee is essential to your whole policy. How can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular support [for its decisions on how Trilateral member nations will conduct their economic and political policies]?</p>\n<p>COOPER: Well, I guess it\u2019s the press\u2019 job to publicize it.</p>\n<p>NOVAK: Yes, but why doesn\u2019t President Carter come out with it and tell the American people that [US] economic and political power is being coordinated by a [Trilateral] committee made up of Henry Owen and six others? After all, if [US] policy is being made on a multinational level, the people should know.</p>\n<p>COOPER: President Carter and Secretary of State Vance have constantly alluded to this in their speeches.</p>\n<p>KAISER: It just hasn\u2019t become an issue.</p>\n<p>SOURCE: \u201cTrilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World Management,\u201d ed. by Holly Sklar, 1980. South End Press, Boston. Pages 192-3.</p>\n<p>Of course, although Kaiser and Cooper claimed everything being manipulated by the Trilateral Commission committee was already out in the open, it wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Their interview slipped under the mainstream media radar, which is to say, it was ignored and buried. It didn\u2019t become a scandal on the level of, say, Watergate, although its essence was far larger than Watergate.</p>\n<p>US economic and political policy run by a committee of the Trilateral Commission\u2014the Commission had been created in 1973 as an \u201cinformal discussion group\u201d by David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who would become Jimmy Carter\u2019s National Security Advisor.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Carter won the presidential election, his aide, Hamilton Jordan, said that if after the inauguration, Cy Vance and Brzezinski came on board as secretary of state and national security adviser, \u201cWe\u2019ve lost. And I\u2019ll quit.\u201d Lost\u2014because both men were powerful members of the Trilateral Commission and their appointment to key positions would signal a surrender of White House control to the Commission.</p>\n<p>Vance and Brzezinski were appointed secretary of state and national security adviser, as Jordan feared. But he didn\u2019t quit. He became Carter\u2019s chief of staff.</p>\n<p>Now consider the vast propaganda efforts of the past 40 years, on so many levels, to install the idea that all nations and peoples of the world are a single Collective.</p>\n<p>From a very high level of political and economic power, this propaganda op has had the objective of grooming the population for a planet that is one coagulated mass, run and managed by one force.</p>\n<p>Deep State.</p>\n<p>Trump, who squashed the Globalist TPP treaty as soon as he was inaugurated, has nevertheless appointed a significant Trilateral member to a major post. Patrick Wood writes (2/6/17):</p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to a White House press release, the first member of the Trilateral Commission has entered the Trump administration as the Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs, where he will sit on the National Security Council [as deputy director]:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Kenneth I. Juster will serve as Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs. He will coordinate the Administration\u2019s international economic policy and integrate it with national security and foreign policy. He will also be the President\u2019s representative and lead U.S. negotiator (\u201cSherpa\u201d) for the annual G-7, G-20, and APEC Summits\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Juster\u2019s duties will take him into the heart of high-level negotiations with foreign governments on economic policy.</p>\n<p>Note: In this article, I\u2019m not listing Trump appointees who are members of another Rockefeller deep-state organization, the Council on Foreign Relations. Suffice to say, the CFR is a brother of the Trilateral Commission, and, when push comes to shove, the lesser brother. And finally, Goldman Sachs, whose people Trump has surrounded himself with, is a corporate member of the CFR\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Jon Rappoport</em></p>\n<p><em>To read about Jon\u2019s mega-collection, <strong>The Matrix Revealed</strong>, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>The author of three explosive collections, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed-vol-1-cd-by-jon-rappoport-mega-info/\" target=\"_blank\">THE MATRIX REVEALED</a>, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">EXIT FROM THE MATRIX</a>, and <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/power-outside-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX</a>, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29<sup>th</sup> District of California.

Men who don\u2019t need to be elected to public office? Men who can laugh at their critics and call them conspiracy theorists and purveyors of fake news? Men who can determine financial and banking policy? Men who can set up corporate tribunals that nullify national courts? Men who can set virtually any national policy agenda they want to?\n\nIf an honest press existed, all this would be out in the open by now.\n\nIf, as many people are now saying, the CIA and NSA and neocons are the unelected Deep State, then the people I\u2019m talking about would be the Deep, Deep State.\n\nRead on.\n\nMany people think the Trilateral Commission (TC), created in 1973 by David Rockefeller, is a relic of an older time.\n\nThink again.\n\nPatrick Wood, author of Trilaterals Over Washington, points out there are only 87 members of the Trilateral Commission who live in America. Obama appointed eleven of them to posts in his administration.\n\nKeep in mind that the original stated goal of the TC was to create \u201ca new international economic order.\u201d Knowing that you have to break eggs to make an omelet, consider how the following TC members, in key Obama posts, could have helped engender further national chaos; erase our sovereign national borders; and install binding international agreements that will envelop our economy and money in a deeper global collective: a new world order:\n\nTim Geithner, Treasury Secretary;\n\nJames Jones, National Security Advisor;\n\nPaul Volker, Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee;\n\nDennis Blair, Director of National Intelligence.\n\nAll Trilateralists.\n\nIn the run-up to his inauguration after the 2008 presidential election, Obama was tutored by the co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n\nIn Europe, the financially embattled nations of Greece and Italy brought in Lucas Papademos and Mario Monti as prime ministers. Both men are Trilateral members, and Monti is the former European chairman of the Trilateral Commission.\n\nIn the US, since 1973, author Wood counts eight out of 10 US Trade Representative appointments, and six out of eight World Bank presidents, as American Trilateral members.\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski wrote, four years before birthing the TC in 1973, with his godfather, David Rockefeller: \u201c[The] nation state as a fundamental unit of man\u2019s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force. International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state.\u201d\n\nSeveral other noteworthy Trilateral members: George HW Bush; Bill Clinton; Dick Cheney; Al Gore. The first three men helped sink the US further into debt by fomenting wars abroad; and Gore\u2019s cap and trade blueprint would destroy industrial economies, while vastly increasing the numbers of people in Third World countries who have no access to modern sources of energy.\n\nDoes all this offer a clue as to why the US economy has failed to recover from the Wall Street debacle of 2008, why the federal bailout was a handout to super-rich criminals, and why Obama took no actions which would have brought about an authentic recovery?\n\nA closer look at Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner\u2019s circle of economic advisers reveals the chilling Trilateral effect: Paul Volker; Alan Greenspan; E. Gerald Corrigan (director, Goldman Sachs); and Peter G Peterson (former CEO, Lehman Brothers, former chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations). These men are all Trilateral members.\n\nHow many foxes in the hen house do we need, before we realize their Trilateral agenda is controlling the direction of our economy?\n\nThe TC has no interest in building up the American economy. They want to torpedo it, as part of the end-game of creating a de facto Globalist management system for the whole planet.\n\nAny doubt on the question of TC goals is answered by David Rockefeller himself, the founder of the TC, in his Memoirs (2003): \u201cSome even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as \u2018internationalists\u2019 and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure\u2014one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.\u201d\n\nEven in what many people mistakenly think of as the TC\u2019s heyday, the 1970s, there were few who realized its overarching power.\n\nHere is a close-up snap shot of a remarkable moment from out of the past. It\u2019s a through-the-looking-glass secret\u2014in the form of a conversation between a reporter, Jeremiah Novak, and two Trilateral Commission members, Karl Kaiser and Richard Cooper. The interview took place in 1978. It concerned the issue of who exactly, during President Carter\u2019s administration, was formulating US economic and political policy.\n\nThe careless and off-hand attitude of Trilateralists Kaiser and Cooper is astonishing. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re saying, \u201cWhat we\u2019re revealing is already out in the open, it\u2019s too late to do anything about it, why are you so worked up, we\u2019ve already won\u2026\u201d\n\nNOVAK (the reporter): Is it true that a private [Trilateral committee] led by Henry Owen of the US and made up of [Trilateral] representatives of the US, UK, West Germany, Japan, France and the EEC is coordinating the economic and political policies of the Trilateral countries [which would include the US]?\n\nCOOPER: Yes, they have met three times.\n\nNOVAK: Yet, in your recent paper you state that this committee should remain informal because to formalize \u2018this function might well prove offensive to some of the Trilateral and other countries which do not take part.\u2019 Who are you afraid of?\n\nKAISER: Many countries in Europe would resent the dominant role that West Germany plays at these [Trilateral] meetings.\n\nCOOPER: Many people still live in a world of separate nations, and they would resent such coordination [of policy].\n\nNOVAK: But this [Trilateral] committee is essential to your whole policy. How can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular support [for its decisions on how Trilateral member nations will conduct their economic and political policies]?\n\nCOOPER: Well, I guess it\u2019s the press\u2019 job to publicize it.\n\nNOVAK: Yes, but why doesn\u2019t President Carter come out with it and tell the American people that [US] economic and political power is being coordinated by a [Trilateral] committee made up of Henry Owen and six others? After all, if [US] policy is being made on a multinational level, the people should know.\n\nCOOPER: President Carter and Secretary of State Vance have constantly alluded to this in their speeches.\n\nKAISER: It just hasn\u2019t become an issue.\n\nSOURCE: \u201cTrilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World Management,\u201d ed. by Holly Sklar, 1980. South End Press, Boston. Pages 192-3.\n\nOf course, although Kaiser and Cooper claimed everything being manipulated by the Trilateral Commission committee was already out in the open, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nTheir interview slipped under the mainstream media radar, which is to say, it was ignored and buried. It didn\u2019t become a scandal on the level of, say, Watergate, although its essence was far larger than Watergate.\n\nUS economic and political policy run by a committee of the Trilateral Commission\u2014the Commission had been created in 1973 as an \u201cinformal discussion group\u201d by David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who would become Jimmy Carter\u2019s National Security Advisor.\n\nShortly after Carter won the presidential election, his aide, Hamilton Jordan, said that if after the inauguration, Cy Vance and Brzezinski came on board as secretary of state and national security adviser, \u201cWe\u2019ve lost. And I\u2019ll quit.\u201d Lost\u2014because both men were powerful members of the Trilateral Commission and their appointment to key positions would signal a surrender of White House control to the Commission.\n\nVance and Brzezinski were appointed secretary of state and national security adviser, as Jordan feared. But he didn\u2019t quit. He became Carter\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nNow consider the vast propaganda efforts of the past 40 years, on so many levels, to install the idea that all nations and peoples of the world are a single Collective.\n\nFrom a very high level of political and economic power, this propaganda op has had the objective of grooming the population for a planet that is one coagulated mass, run and managed by one force.\n\nDeep State.\n\nTrump, who squashed the Globalist TPP treaty as soon as he was inaugurated, has nevertheless appointed a significant Trilateral member to a major post. Patrick Wood writes (2/6/17):\n\n\u201cAccording to a White House press release, the first member of the Trilateral Commission has entered the Trump administration as the Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs, where he will sit on the National Security Council [as deputy director]:\n\n\u201c\u2019Kenneth I. Juster will serve as Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs. He will coordinate the Administration\u2019s international economic policy and integrate it with national security and foreign policy. He will also be the President\u2019s representative and lead U.S. negotiator (\u201cSherpa\u201d) for the annual G-7, G-20, and APEC Summits\u2019.\u201d\n\nJuster\u2019s duties will take him into the heart of high-level negotiations with foreign governments on economic policy.\n\nNote: In this article, I\u2019m not listing Trump appointees who are members of another Rockefeller deep-state organization, the Council on Foreign Relations. Suffice to say, the CFR is a brother of the Trilateral Commission, and, when push comes to shove, the lesser brother. And finally, Goldman Sachs, whose people Trump has surrounded himself with, is a corporate member of the CFR\u2026\n\nJon Rappoport\n\nTo read about Jon\u2019s mega-collection, The Matrix Revealed, click here.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
