However, not before the rest of the Western media ran similar headlines \u2014 all which have since been changed.</p>\n<p>With great reach comes great responsibility. To erroneously parrot entirely fake information that could potentially set off a world war, to millions of your readers, without first checking the facts, is irresponsible, to say the least.</p>\n<p>Below is a short list of other examples of fake news, from a previous report by the Free Thought Project.

One glaring and extremely relevant instance is how the corporate media became a parroting organization for the lies leading up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\n\u201cIntelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised,\u201d then-president George Bush asserted in a public address on March 17, 2003. \u201cThis regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq\u2019s neighbors and against Iraq\u2019s people.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s assertions were questioned by not only human rights experts, but by U.N. weapons inspectors and countless others \u2014 so shortly after the U.S. invaded the sovereign nation, the New York Times took up the slack to fill in the appropriate casus belli.\n\nNow, more than a decade after hundreds of thousands of innocent people were slaughtered in the conflict created by the United State, the world knows \u2014 there were never any weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhile the US often invents fake stories to convince the population to support its wars for profit, its media also parrots other dangerous fake news stories that have potential for massive and catastrophic results.\n\nCase in point: NORTH KOREA FIRES PROJECTILE, MEDIA SAYS: XINHUA \u2013Bloomberg\n\nAs ZeroHedge reports:\n\nAs expected \u2013 and feared \u2013 during the annual \u201cDay of the Sun\u201d celebration parade (celebrating the birth of the nation\u2019s founder), Bloomberg blasted a headline that Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that North Korea has fired a projectile. NORTH KOREA FIRES PROJECTILE, MEDIA SAYS: XINHUA On its website, Bloomberg immediately picked up the story, and ran with \u201cNorth Korea Fires Projectile Media, Says Xinhua\u201d (at a url which still reads: \u201chttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-15/north-korea-fires-projectile-media-says-xinhua\u201c) However, it appears that the headline scanning algos made a collosal error, and that Xinhua interpreted events quite incorrectly as it was, as CBC and Reuters reports, the appearance of a new submarine-launched missile at the parade for the first time:\n\nNORTH KOREA SUBMARINE-LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILE SEEN AT MILITARY PARADE FOR FIRST TIME: RTRS North Korea displayed its submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) for the first time on Saturday ahead of a massive military parade in the capital, Pyongyang.\n\nImmediately after they almost kicked off World War 3, both Bloomberg and Xinhua rushed to correct the headlines.\n\nXINHUA CLARIFIES HEADLINE ON NORTH KOREAN MISSILE\n\nN.KOREA DISPLAYS BALLISTIC MISSILE AT MILITARY PARADE: XINHUA\n\nLuckily, their retractions were timely enough to avoid actual military confrontation. However, not before the rest of the Western media ran similar headlines \u2014 all which have since been changed.\n\nWith great reach comes great responsibility. To erroneously parrot entirely fake information that could potentially set off a world war, to millions of your readers, without first checking the facts, is irresponsible, to say the least.\n\nBelow is a short list of other examples of fake news, from a previous report by the Free Thought Project. All of these instances below, just like the instance above could\u2019ve done, resulted in the suffering and death of millions.\n\nGulf of Tonkin Incident\n\nOften, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact \u2014 and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident \u2014 perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war.\n\nOn August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported \u201cPresident Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and \u2018certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam\u2019 after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.\u201d Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t true. At all. In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam \u2014 leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.\n\nIn 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House. But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn\u2019t be disputed.\n\nTom Wells, author of the exhaustive expos\u00e9 \u201cThe War Within: America\u2019s Battle Over Vietnam,\u201d explained the media egregiously erred in \u201calmost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information\u201d and \u201creluctance to question official pronouncements on \u2018national security issues.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it\u2019s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did.\n\nSuppression of brutality perpetrated in Bahrain during the Arab Spring\n\nCNN sent reporter Amber Lyon and a crew to U.S. ally Bahrain for a documentary about technology\u2019s role in the 2011 people\u2019s uprising known as the Arab Spring, ultimately titled \u201ciRevolution: Online Warriors of the Arab Spring\u201d \u2014 but what they encountered instead bore the hallmarks of a repressive and violent regime, and its attempt to filter and censor the truth. Lyon and the other CNN reporters went to great lengths to speak with sources participating in the massive uprising \u2014 one the Bahraini government wished to quash at all costs.\n\n\u201cBy the time the CNN crew arrived,\u201d the Guardian reported, \u201cmany of the sources who had agreed to speak to them were either in hiding or had disappeared. Regime opponents whom they interviewed suffered recriminations, as did ordinary citizens who worked with them as fixers. Leading human rights activist Nabeel Rajab was charged with crimes shortly after speaking to the CNN team. A doctor who gave the crew a tour of his village and arranged meetings with government opponents, Saeed Ayyad, had his house burned to the ground shortly after. Their local fixer was fired ten days after working with them.\u201d\n\nEven the CNN crew experienced the wrath of the regime, upon showing up to interview one source, the Guardian continued, \u201c\u201820 heavily-armed men\u2019, whose faces were \u2018covered with black ski masks\u2019, \u2018jumped from military vehicles\u2019, and then \u2018pointed machine guns at\u2019 the journalists, forcing them to the ground. The regime\u2019s security forces seized their cameras and deleted their photos and video footage, and then detained and interrogated them for the next six hours.\u201d\n\nAfter returning to the U.S., Lyon felt it her duty to expose the abuse being perpetrated by the government of an ally nation \u2014 but CNN International didn\u2019t agree. CNN U.S. eventually aired the one-hour documentary. Once. CNN International never did \u2014 worse, the organization gave Lyon the cold shoulder, ignoring her repeated requests to return to Bahrain, which would have put CNN ahead of the game in reporting government brutality. Its failure to air the documentary and refusal to provide justification for doing so angered seasoned CNN and other mainstream established journalists across the board.\n\nLyon met with CNN International president Tony Maddox twice \u2014 he first promised to investigate why the documentary wasn\u2019t aired, and then turned against her, warning the journalist not to discuss the matter publicly. Bahraini officials contacted CNN International repeatedly complaining about Lyon\u2019s continued reporting on what she\u2019d witnessed. Intimidation continued until she was eventually laid off, putatively for an unrelated matter.\n\nAttempting to save face, CNN International rebuffed the Guardian\u2019s account and interview with Lyon \u2014 but the effort was an impotent justification for the obvious failure of integrity.\n\nBut threats for Lyon to remain silent followed her off the job, and when she persisted in exposing the Bahraini regime, as well as the suppression by CNN, the outlet sent a stern warning to halt. Lyon, however, said she had never signed a non-disclosure agreement and would not be pressured into their lies \u2014 ultimately walking away reputation in hand \u2014 something that could not be said for CNN.\n\nThat time Fox News hired a CIA operative who wasn\u2019t a CIA operative\n\nWayne Shelby Simmons made guest appearances on Fox News as a security expert with insider expertise from his work as a CIA operative \u2014 for over a decade. However, Simmons had never been employed by the agency \u2014 in fact, the imposter\u2019s lies eventually caught up with him and he was arrested and sentenced to 33 months in prison.\n\n\u201cInstead of verifying whether Simmons had actually worked for the CIA, Fox News and the Agency allowed him to make fools out of Bill O\u2019Reilly, Sean Hannity, Andrew Napolitano, Neil Cavuto, and everyone at Fox & Friends for over the last twelve years. After building a false reputation as a CIA agent on Fox News, Simmons obtained an interim security clearance when an unnamed government contractor hired him in 2008. Simmons also falsely claimed on national security forms that his prior arrests and criminal convictions were directly related to his supposed intelligence work for the CIA, and that he had previously held a top secret security clearance from 1973 to 2000,\u201d The Free Thought Project\u2019s Andrew Emett explained.\n\nIn other words, mainstream Fox News didn\u2019t bother with journalism at all \u2014 proffering fake expertise as the real deal \u2014 because the outlet failed the most basic of tasks any hourly wage employer would perform.\n\nSimmons\u2019 commentaries weren\u2019t harmless stabs in the dark, either \u2014 relentlessly parroting baseless Islamophobic rhetoric to drum up support for the government\u2019s insidious war on terror likely poisoned the minds of thousands of viewers, furthering the already divisive atmosphere in the U.S.\n\nVapid anti-marijuana propaganda and the furtherance of the war on drugs\n\nAccording to the Drug Policy Alliance, over $51 billion is spent fighting the war on drugs in the United States \u2014 each year. In 2015, a striking 38.6 percent of all arrests for drug possession were for cannabis \u2014 643,121 people were arrested for marijuana-related offenses.\n\nWhat those figures don\u2019t show are the millions of lives ruined by criminal conviction for the government\u2019s unjustifiable quest to eradicate, demonize, and vilify this beneficial plant. It would be an impossible task to tally the number of families whose homes have been destroyed by SWAT teams searching for marijuana \u2014 whether or not police bothered to verify an address. An untold number of others have been slain by police for the same reason.\n\nBut worst of all, the mainstream media propagates nonsensical, false propaganda about cannabis to convince the gullible and ignorant among us to equate it with heroin, cocaine, and other \u2018illicit\u2019 substances. And while a majority of the populace has seen through such lies, some outlets have obstinately continued the drug war \u2014 seemingly of their own volition.\n\nOne stunning example occurred in March last year, when Dr. David Samadi made a guest appearance on Fox News to fearmonger the horrors of marijuana and scare the bejeezus out of the viewing audience.\n\n\u201cIt actually causes heart attacks. It increases your heart rate. And on and on,\u201d Samadi claimed, fecklessly distorting statistics. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing in Colorado that we had 13 kids that came to the emergency [room] and ended up in the ICU as a result of overdose from marijuana. Now we have crack babies coming in because pregnant women are smoking this whole marijuana business.\u201d\n\nFortunately, the Internet has provided the public with alternatives to these corporate media lies \u2014 and as of two years ago, despite these and other claims about pot being a dangerous substance, Pew Research Center found fully 69 percent of the population felt alcohol was more harmful than cannabis.\n\n* * *\n\nWhile this list presents only a few of the bigger lies of the corporate press, there are innumerable examples of its proud history of actual fake news. Keep these in mind when the mainstream presstitutes rush to reprint a hit list targeting journalists and outlets whose narratives counter the establishment. Indeed, it would be the corporate media \u2014 with its vast captive audience \u2014 who most deserves to be listed as propagators of lies.\n\nCourtesy of The Free Thought Project\n\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.
