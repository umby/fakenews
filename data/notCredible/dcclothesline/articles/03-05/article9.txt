While it is true that Christianity is still growing on a global basis, it is not growing nearly as rapidly as Islam. So unless something changes, Christianity will only be the second largest faith in the world by the year 2070. According to this newly released report, Islam is the only major religion that is growing faster than the global population overall, and it is being projected that the number of Muslims on the planet will rise by a staggering 73 percent <a title=\"between 2010 and 2050\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/01/islam-will-largest-religion-world-2070-says-report/\" target=\"_blank\">between 2010 and 2050</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged\">I</span>slam is the only religion growing faster than the world\u2019s population, and it will be the largest in the world by 2070, research has found.</p>\n<p>US-based Pew Research Center analyzed demographic change among the world\u2019s major religions and found that the world\u2019s population of Muslims will grow by 73 percent between 2010 and 2050, compared to 35 percent for Christians, the next fastest-growing faith.</p>\n<p data-mediaconductor-processed=\"true\">The world\u2019s population will grow by 37 percent over the same period. If those rates of growth continue past 2050, Muslims will outnumber Christians by 2070, the report found.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course there are religious groups that are growing even faster than Islam, but they were not part of this study.</p>\n<p>For example, I have <a title=\"previously written\" href=\"http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/witchcraft-islam-and-humanism-are-filling-the-spiritual-void-left-by-the-dying-church\" target=\"_blank\">previously written</a> about how witchcraft is the fastest growing faith in America, and yesterday I wrote about how membership in the Satanic Temple in the United States <a title=\"has been absolutely exploding\" href=\"http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/the-satanic-temple-has-experienced-a-huge-surge-in-membership-following-the-election-of-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">has been absolutely exploding</a> since Donald Trump was elected.</p>\n<p>So it isn\u2019t just Islam that is gaining ground.</p>\n<p>But without a doubt, Islam is now the dominant worldview on much of the planet. Many in the western world tend to think of it as a Middle Eastern religion, but the truth is that most Muslims actually live <a title=\"in the Asia-Pacific region\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4270576/Islam-popular-global-religion-2070.html\" target=\"_blank\">in the Asia-Pacific region</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some 62 percent of Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region with large populations in Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey, Pew researchers said.</p>\n<p>In 2050, India is set to take over from Indonesia as the country with the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, according to the study.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In India, there truly is a battle going on for the spiritual future of that nation right now. Christianity and Islam are both making a tremendous amount of progress, and this has greatly upset a lot of traditional Hindu groups.</p>\n<p>Islam is making a lot of progress in Europe as well. A tremendous amount of immigration has caused the number of European Muslims to surge in recent years, and this new report is projecting that 10 percent of all Europeans will belong to Islam by the year 2050.</p>\n<p>Here in the United States, Muslims still only make up a very small percentage of the population, but that percentage is growing too. The following comes directly out of <a title=\"the new Pew Research Center report\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/27/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\">the new Pew Research Center report</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2015, according to our best estimate, there were 3.3 million Muslims of all ages in the U.S., or about 1% of the U.S. population. Pew Research Center\u2019s 2014 Religious Landscape Study (conducted in English and Spanish) found that 0.9% of U.S. adults identify as Muslims. A 2011 survey of Muslim Americans, which was conducted in English as well as Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, estimated that there were 1.8 million Muslim adults (and 2.75 million Muslims of all ages) in the country. That survey also found that a majority of U.S. Muslims (63%) are immigrants.</p>\n<p>Our demographic projections estimate that Muslims will make up 2.1% of the U.S. population by the year 2050, surpassing people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion as the second-largest faith group in the country (not including people who say they have no religion).</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div></blockquote>\n<p>Once the number of Muslims in the United States surpasses the number of Jewish people, what impact will that have on U.S. politics?</p>\n<p>That is something to think about.</p>\n<p>The report indicated that there are a couple of primary reasons why Islam is growing so rapidly around the world.</p>\n<p>First of all, Muslims tend to have larger families than everyone else. The report said that the average Muslim woman has 3.1 children during her lifetime, while all other groups only have 2.3 children per woman.</p>\n<p>So in the end, Islam could end up dominating the world just by simply making more babies than everyone else.</p>\n<p>Muslims are also younger on average than other religious groups. According to the report, on a global basis Muslims are \u201cseven years younger than the median age of non-Muslims\u201d.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when Muslims become dominant in a society they often want to impose their systems of government, law, economics, etc. on everyone else. That is why \u201csharia law\u201d is such a sensitive issue, and the report found that in some Islamic countries an overwhelming majority of Muslims <a title=\"want to impose sharia law on everyone else\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/27/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\">want to impose sharia law on everyone else</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>For instance, a Pew Research Center <a title=\"survey of Muslims in 39 countries\" href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">survey of Muslims in 39 countries</a> asked Muslims whether they want sharia law, a legal code based on the Quran and other Islamic scripture, to be the official law of the land in their country. Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia \u2013 including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%) \u2013 relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In his new book entitled \u201c<a title=\"Mystery Babylon: Unlocking the Bible\u2019s Greatest Prophetic Mystery\" href=\"http://amzn.to/2lY4gkk\" target=\"_blank\">Mystery Babylon: Unlocking the Bible\u2019s Greatest Prophetic Mystery</a>\u201c, best-selling author Joel Richardson suggests that the identity of the \u201cMystery Babylon\u201d that we read about in the Book of Revelation could actually be Mecca.</p>\n<p>I am not sure whether that is true or not, but nobody can deny that Islam is one of the most dominant forces on the entire planet in 2017, and it looks like it is going to become even more dominant in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>And that is troubling news for Christians and those of other faiths, because all you have to do is to look at countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iran to see what happens to other faiths once Islam takes total control of a nation.</p>\n<p>In a truly Islamic state, there is no room for religious freedom, and so the growth of Islam is likely to be one of the greatest global threats to the free exercise of religion for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/new-report-says-islam-will-surpass-christianity-and-become-the-largest-religion-in-the-world\" target=\"_blank\">End of the American Dream</a></em></p>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Don't forget to follow the D.C.

I sure as hell do not.  But what I am interested in, is the fact if these worthless Muslim commence to interfere in our Western values, they willl pay a rapid price for their mishavior.  In addition, I have often imparted that planet Earth needs to get rid of George &#8220;NAZI&#8221; Soros, the worthless Hungarian, whom during WW2, in his native land, joined a group of NAZI thugs whose bent, was to evict JEWS from their homes and to confiscate their property for Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich.  Currently, Soros is the ramrod of &#8220;THE NEW WORLD ORDER,&#8221; based upon George Orwell&#8217;s<br />\nbook, &#8220;1984,&#8221; where Big-Brother is observing everyone, even in the bedroom, and to get rid of this worthless Black turd of a half-baked POS of token Tar-Baby of an ex-44th  POTUS whom is seeking the rise of Islam at the expense of we in the West.  This Black turd from Kenya, is the ramrod for &#8220;THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD,&#8221; as he and his worthless effn desert turds, are seeking a global Caliphate with this Black turd, as its first Caliph.  For the past 8 years, this worthless Black turd of an ex-44th POTUS, has committed too many felonies to sweep under the carpet, therefore, why hasn&#8217;t this Black turd been held accoutable for his treasonous and seditious character?  This Black turd was groomed in Russia, during his missing year accountability in the early 1980&#8217;s, to become what he is today, a worthless Black &#8220;F,&#8221; that whom has shown no allegiance to the the United States, along with his girlfriend, George &#8220;NAZI&#8221; Soros, whom must be held accoutable for their felonies against the United States.  Soros has learned his lessons well from the NAZIS, and after he accumulated his fortune from the backs of the American people, he has funded too many upheavals, against the established order, in order to maintain a state of confusion to wage his undeclared and covert war against the West.  Currently, we have Soros and this Black turd of a Kenyan Pigmy, working both sides of the coin, but each are seeking to become planet Earth&#8217;s &#8220;WIZARD OF OZ.&#8221;  Therefore, America, we have to ask ourselves, which of these two turds do we prefer?  In the words of our fabulous 45th POTUS, we must get rid of these two political turds, and then concentrate how to make &#8220;America Great Again.&#8221;  Note too, this worthless Black turd<br />\nmust be considered to be an illegal alien, as he has secured his paper trail for<br />\nobsvious reasons of deceit from the American people, because there is evidently<br />\nsigns in his character that would incriminate him and his gang of worthless effn<br />\nCommunists.  And, this worthless half-bake Mulatto, maintains the odascity to accuse<br />\nTrump, in Alinsky fashion, of committing the same crimes that this Black turd<br />\nhas committed over a period of 8 effn years.  Once this Black turd and his girlfriend,<br />\nSoros have been curtailed, planet Earth can return to rotating normally on its axis.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-23229\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-23229\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-23229\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-23229\">anarchyst</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-23229\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-23229\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Islam is a foreign political system masquerading as a &#8220;religion&#8221;. As such there need be NO Constitutional &#8220;protections&#8221; for this foreign political system. ALL muslims should be required to register as &#8220;agents of a foreign government&#8221; with the U S State department pending mandatory deportation to countries of origin. . . </p>\n<p> It seems to me there is another &#8220;foreign political system&#8221; that is interfering in MY country&#8217;s foreign policy and is wreaking havoc in my country . . . zionism. The same registration and deportation requirements should apply to dual-nationality zionists also.  Dual-nationality should be PROHIBITED for all U S residents.  American citizenship should be revoked for all those residing in the U S who hold &#8220;dual citizenship&#8221;.  </p>\n<p>When you take a &#8220;people&#8221; that is stuck in the 6th century (with 6th century beliefs), and (attempt to) bring them into 21st century society, there will be nothing but trouble. With Islam, assimilation is NEVER part of the &#8220;equation&#8221;. Conquest and forced conversion to Islam is the only thing muslims understand. IF the countries of the west were smart (they&#8217;re not), they would disengage any operations in Islamic countries and &#8220;repatriate&#8221; all muslims back to their countries of origin . . . </p>\n<p>Ron Paul is correct . . . much of today&#8217;s &#8220;terrorism&#8221; is &#8220;blowback&#8221; from our (western countries&#8217;) interference in muslim countries. . .better to ship them all back.

Note too, the former Black turd of a 44th POTUS is a graduate of &#8220;AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.&#8221;  Note also, for the mniorities, the bar has been lowered, but for the Caucasians and the Asians, the bar remains the same or has been increased.

While it is true that Christianity is still growing on a global basis, it is not growing nearly as rapidly as Islam. So unless something changes, Christianity will only be the second largest faith in the world by the year 2070. According to this newly released report, Islam is the only major religion that is growing faster than the global population overall, and it is being projected that the number of Muslims on the planet will rise by a staggering 73 percent between 2010 and 2050\u2026\n\nIslam is the only religion growing faster than the world\u2019s population, and it will be the largest in the world by 2070, research has found. US-based Pew Research Center analyzed demographic change among the world\u2019s major religions and found that the world\u2019s population of Muslims will grow by 73 percent between 2010 and 2050, compared to 35 percent for Christians, the next fastest-growing faith. The world\u2019s population will grow by 37 percent over the same period. If those rates of growth continue past 2050, Muslims will outnumber Christians by 2070, the report found.\n\nOf course there are religious groups that are growing even faster than Islam, but they were not part of this study.\n\nFor example, I have previously written about how witchcraft is the fastest growing faith in America, and yesterday I wrote about how membership in the Satanic Temple in the United States has been absolutely exploding since Donald Trump was elected.\n\nSo it isn\u2019t just Islam that is gaining ground.\n\nBut without a doubt, Islam is now the dominant worldview on much of the planet. Many in the western world tend to think of it as a Middle Eastern religion, but the truth is that most Muslims actually live in the Asia-Pacific region\u2026\n\nSome 62 percent of Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region with large populations in Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey, Pew researchers said. In 2050, India is set to take over from Indonesia as the country with the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, according to the study.\n\nIn India, there truly is a battle going on for the spiritual future of that nation right now. Christianity and Islam are both making a tremendous amount of progress, and this has greatly upset a lot of traditional Hindu groups.\n\nIslam is making a lot of progress in Europe as well. A tremendous amount of immigration has caused the number of European Muslims to surge in recent years, and this new report is projecting that 10 percent of all Europeans will belong to Islam by the year 2050.\n\nHere in the United States, Muslims still only make up a very small percentage of the population, but that percentage is growing too. The following comes directly out of the new Pew Research Center report\u2026\n\nIn 2015, according to our best estimate, there were 3.3 million Muslims of all ages in the U.S., or about 1% of the U.S. population. Pew Research Center\u2019s 2014 Religious Landscape Study (conducted in English and Spanish) found that 0.9% of U.S. adults identify as Muslims. A 2011 survey of Muslim Americans, which was conducted in English as well as Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, estimated that there were 1.8 million Muslim adults (and 2.75 million Muslims of all ages) in the country. That survey also found that a majority of U.S. Muslims (63%) are immigrants. Our demographic projections estimate that Muslims will make up 2.1% of the U.S. population by the year 2050, surpassing people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion as the second-largest faith group in the country (not including people who say they have no religion).\n\nOnce the number of Muslims in the United States surpasses the number of Jewish people, what impact will that have on U.S. politics?\n\nThat is something to think about.\n\nThe report indicated that there are a couple of primary reasons why Islam is growing so rapidly around the world.\n\nFirst of all, Muslims tend to have larger families than everyone else. The report said that the average Muslim woman has 3.1 children during her lifetime, while all other groups only have 2.3 children per woman.\n\nSo in the end, Islam could end up dominating the world just by simply making more babies than everyone else.\n\nMuslims are also younger on average than other religious groups. According to the report, on a global basis Muslims are \u201cseven years younger than the median age of non-Muslims\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, when Muslims become dominant in a society they often want to impose their systems of government, law, economics, etc. on everyone else. That is why \u201csharia law\u201d is such a sensitive issue, and the report found that in some Islamic countries an overwhelming majority of Muslims want to impose sharia law on everyone else\u2026\n\nFor instance, a Pew Research Center survey of Muslims in 39 countries asked Muslims whether they want sharia law, a legal code based on the Quran and other Islamic scripture, to be the official law of the land in their country. Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia \u2013 including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%) \u2013 relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law.\n\nIn his new book entitled \u201cMystery Babylon: Unlocking the Bible\u2019s Greatest Prophetic Mystery\u201c, best-selling author Joel Richardson suggests that the identity of the \u201cMystery Babylon\u201d that we read about in the Book of Revelation could actually be Mecca.\n\nI am not sure whether that is true or not, but nobody can deny that Islam is one of the most dominant forces on the entire planet in 2017, and it looks like it is going to become even more dominant in the years ahead.\n\nAnd that is troubling news for Christians and those of other faiths, because all you have to do is to look at countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iran to see what happens to other faiths once Islam takes total control of a nation.\n\nIn a truly Islamic state, there is no room for religious freedom, and so the growth of Islam is likely to be one of the greatest global threats to the free exercise of religion for the foreseeable future.\n\nCourtesy of End of the American Dream", "images": ["http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=640", "https://i0.wp.com/endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mecca-Public-Domain-460x265.jpg?resize=460%2C265", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mecca-Public-Domain-460x265.jpg", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/images/rss/orange-medium.png"], "videos": []}
