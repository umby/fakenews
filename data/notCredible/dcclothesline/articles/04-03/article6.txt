It\u2019s the plural part he gets wrong. The soldier goes low. Her friends shoot him dead. But he\u2019s not entirely wrong either. There will be deaths. Even if they aren\u2019t at Orly Airport.</p>\n<p>French Police go on to investigate the motive of the Tunisian Muslim settler. His father insists that he wasn\u2019t a terrorist. The media rushes to blame drugs for his attack. It reports widely on the drugs in his system rather than the Koran found on his body. No one asks if he was on drugs or on Jihad.</p>\n<p>Ziyed Ben Belgacem had been in and out of prison. He was known to the authorities as a potential Jihadist and had been investigated for \u201cradicalization\u201d back in 2015. He had been suspected of burglaries last year and had been paroled in the fall. The system had failed all over again.</p>\n<p>Prince William and Kate had been in Paris meeting with victims of the Bataclan Islamic terror attack. They returned to the UK, but media reports emphasize that the latest attack wouldn\u2019t change their plans. But the UK was no refuge from Islamic terror. Not even Westminster Palace was.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Khalid Masood, a Muslim convert, rents a car in a town near Birmingham from an Enterprise rent-a-car shop sandwiched between a Staples and a beauty salon offering walk-in eyebrow waxing. Over a fifth of Birmingham is Muslim and by the time the bloodshed was over and Masood was in the hospital, police raided a flat over a restaurant advertising \u201cA Taste of Persia\u201d.</p>\n<p>Because diversity is our strength.</p>\n<p>Masood\u2019s victims were certainly diverse. The men and women he ran over or pushed off Westminster Bridge included Brits, Americans, Romanians, Greeks, Chinese, South Koreans, Italians, Irish, Portuguese, Polish and French. That is the new form that diversity takes in the more multicultural cities.</p>\n<p>The victims are diverse. The killers are Muslim.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister May spoke of it as a place where \u201cpeople of all nationalities and cultures gather to celebrate what it means to be free.\u201d But not all nationalities and cultures. Some come there to celebrate what it means to kill infidels for the greater glory of Allah. Just as some pray for London and others pray for the flag of Islam to fly over Westminster Palace.</p>\n<p>Khalid Masood, like Ziyed Ben Belgacem, had been in and out of prison. Like France\u2019s Tunisian Muslim terror settler, the UK\u2019s Muslim terror convert had been investigated for \u201cviolent extremism\u201d.</p>\n<p>Nothing came of it.</p>\n<p>For thirty years, Masood went in and out of prison. And one fine day he rented a car and began killing. He was on the radar, but nothing was done. And now some are dead and others are wounded. And the politicians who could have prevented it give their speeches and celebrate the magnificent diversity that filled hospitals with the citizens of a dozen nations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I speak, millions will be boarding trains and aeroplanes to travel to London, and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth,\u201d Prime Minister May declared, throwing in a pitch for tourism. \u201cIt is in these actions &#8211; millions of acts of normality &#8211; that we find the best response to terrorism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Come to London. Stroll and see the sights. You probably won\u2019t get Allahuakbared to death. And if you do, the best response is a million acts of normality, apathy and denial.</p>\n<p>Mayor Sadiq Khan vowed that after a brief vigil, it would be &#8220;business as usual&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He was right.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Mohammed, a Tunisian Muslim tries to drive a car through a pedestrian mall on a major shopping street in Antwerp. It was right around the anniversary of the Brussels bombings in which Moroccan Muslim settler terrorists had killed 32 people and wounded 300.</p>\n<p>And a year later it was business as usual.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, King Philippe had dedicated a memorial in Brussels titled, \u2018Wounded But Still Standing in Front of the Inconceivable\u2019. &#8220;We have to stand up and say &#8216;no&#8217; to those acts that are not believable, that are not bearable,&#8221; its sculptor insisted.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>But the seventh King of the Belgians had a somewhat different message. \u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of each and every one of us to make our society more humane, and more just. Let\u2019s learn to listen to each other again, to respect each other\u2019s weaknesses,\u201d he said. \u201cAbove all, let us dare to be tender.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Tunisian Muslim driving into a pedestrian mall did not dare to be \u201ctender\u201d. He didn\u2019t respect the weaknesses of a society that tolerated him.</p>\n<p>Belgian soldiers deployed for the anniversary spotted him. The police gave chase. Pedestrians scurried out of the way. The Muslim settler from France was taken into custody for endangering the public. It is hoped that the arrest was made in a properly tender fashion.</p>\n<p>Police found a riot gun, knives and fake passports in his car.</p>\n<p>The Antwerp police chief said that Mohammed had been known to the police and had been involved in the illegal possession of weapons in France. But official reports blamed the drugs and alcohol in his system. Like fellow Tunisian Ziyed Ben Belgacem, he wasn\u2019t a terrorist, just a drunk and a junkie.</p>\n<p>The police urged everyone to keep calm and return to normalcy. Everything was being done to ensure the safety of Antwerp residents and tourists.</p>\n<p>Business as usual.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the Antwerp Town Hall had gone from flying British colors in solidarity with the victims of the London attack to worrying over an attack at home. Just as William and Kate had come from terror in France to terror at home.</p>\n<p>British authorities claimed that they foiled a dozen terror attacks last year. There are arrests for terror plots in France and Germany. Every week there is either a terror plot or a memorial for the last terror attack before we are told to go on with our million acts of normalcy.</p>\n<p>Some days the terrorists screw up. They pick what they think is an easy target, but she refuses to let go of the rifle. Or they overestimate how much alcohol and cocaine they need to nerve themselves up to kill and die. Other times they get it right. Or right enough. And the news flashes around the world.</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way it wasn\u2019t life that became normal, but terror. And the insistence on normalcy just normalizes the terror. A week with three terror attacks across Europe is no longer extraordinary. We have come to expect that there will be men trying to stab and run us over from Paris to Antwerp to London. And we have come to expect another Islamic terror plot targeting Kansas City, Miami, Columbia, New York, San Bernardino, Boston, Tampa, Dallas, Rochester, Springfield and any city.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t know when or where the next attack will come. But we know whom it will come from.</p>\n<p>The question is what are we going to do about it? We can pretend to be baffled the next time some Jihadi with a rap sheet taller than the London Eye and longer than London Bridge goes on a killing spree. We can nod our heads while the politicians throw a vigil and encourage a million acts of apathy.</p>\n<p>Or we can end the flow of future terrorists and deport the existing ones.</p>\n<p>Because they can\u2019t run us over if we don\u2019t let them in. They can\u2019t bomb us if we don\u2019t let them stay.</p>\n<p>We can listen to King Philippe and \u201cdare to be tender\u201d. Decades of such tenderness are what led us here. Or we can dare to make the hard choices that will make us and our children safe for generations.</p>\n<p>Saturday. Wednesday. Thursday.

Everywhere these two<br />\nethnic groups congregate in a civilized society, trouble is certain to follow, a global<br />\nstatement that has proven to be true for decades.  Therefore, why do global leaders<br />\nturn the other cheek and permit these two ethnic groups to perpetuate their evil cause. To this I say, from a Muslim&#8217;s early birth, to their short or lengthy demise, it does not take a rocket-scientist to maintain that the Muslim Koran iis the culprit in how a Muslim perpetuates its evil contents, in the name of ALLAH.  Remove the Koran from circulation in every Western country, similar to how Hitler removed certain books in which he viewed detrimental to his evil cause.  Without the crutch of the Koran to rely upon, the average Muslim is dead in the water.  I remember distinctly, as an American citizen, how the Black Community perpetuated their movement during the 1960&#8217;s and how city fathers were reluctant to deter them, for fear of further escalation.  Today, the same mentality is current, using the incidents of Baltimore,<br />\nand Ferguson, and the origin of &#8220;BLACK LIVES MATTER.&#8221;  City fathers are reluctant to call out Muslims, for fear of further escalation, but if before WW2 against the Japanese and the Germans, the same mentality held true, more than likely Americans would be speaking at least 3 languages, English, Japanese and German.  But, our Western Allies did not view conquest as a positive gesture, and therefore, most of the entire planet grouped together to form an alliance to rid planet Earth, of the Japanese and German menace.  The difference in those days, was the fact that a declaration of war was decared against these two enemies, but today, global leaders are either afraid or reluctant to declare a total war against Islam for fear of further escalation.  Our 45th POTUS has declared 6 Muslim nations, as persona non grata, for a certain period of time, but has incurred problems from certain courts whom have blocked his intentions of protecting the American people, as he promised during his campaign in 2016.  As far as I can determine, any American President, maintains the authority to<br />\ndetermine whom is permitted to enter the United States, or whom is not permitted to<br />\nenter the U.S.  Congress maintains no influence in this matter.  Therefore, why has<br />\nour 45th POTUS, permitted these courts to hold sway over his Constitutional<br />\npower, whom can enter the U.S. and whom cannot.  What am I missing here?  During<br />\nWW2, President Roosevelt determined that ALL German, Italian, and Japanese<br />\nAmericans, currently residing in the United States, must be herded into camps for<br />\nthe duration of the war.  It may have been a cruel endeavor, but, under the circum-<br />\nsances, it was a method that proved worthy of FDR&#8217;s decision until the end of the<br />\nwar.  Therefore, my fellow Americans, have we not reached the same point in time<br />\nwhen deaing with our enemies, because ALL Muslims in every country on this planet,<br />\nowe allegiance to Islam and ALLAH, and not to the host nation that they have in-<br />\nvaded.  it is time once again, to herd our common enemy, the &#8220;MUSLIMS,&#8221; into camps<br />\nuntil the menace of Islam has been eliminated.  How the menace of Islam is to be<br />\neliminated, will become a challenging endeavor for our world leaders.  The United<br />\nNations cannot be counted upon to offer any concrete suggestions or ultimatums,<br />\nprimarily because they are part of this universal problem, as they are in cahoots with<br />\nthe New World Order, ramrodded by George &#8220;NAZI&#8221; Soros.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n            </ul>\n\n\n        </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar disqus_url = 'http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/04/03/the-victims-are-diverse-the-killers-are-muslim/';\nvar disqus_identifier = '71192 http://www.dcclothesline.com/?p=71192';\nvar disqus_container_id = 'disqus_thread';\nvar disqus_shortname = 'dcclothesline';\nvar disqus_title = \"The Victims are Diverse.

He grabs a female soldier from behind and grapples for her rifle while holding a pellet gun to her head. He warns the other soldiers to drop their rifles and raise their hands.\n\nHe shouts, \u201cI am here to die in the name of Allah \u2026 There will be deaths.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s mostly right. It\u2019s the plural part he gets wrong. The soldier goes low. Her friends shoot him dead. But he\u2019s not entirely wrong either. There will be deaths. Even if they aren\u2019t at Orly Airport.\n\nFrench Police go on to investigate the motive of the Tunisian Muslim settler. His father insists that he wasn\u2019t a terrorist. The media rushes to blame drugs for his attack. It reports widely on the drugs in his system rather than the Koran found on his body. No one asks if he was on drugs or on Jihad.\n\nZiyed Ben Belgacem had been in and out of prison. He was known to the authorities as a potential Jihadist and had been investigated for \u201cradicalization\u201d back in 2015. He had been suspected of burglaries last year and had been paroled in the fall. The system had failed all over again.\n\nPrince William and Kate had been in Paris meeting with victims of the Bataclan Islamic terror attack. They returned to the UK, but media reports emphasize that the latest attack wouldn\u2019t change their plans. But the UK was no refuge from Islamic terror. Not even Westminster Palace was.\n\nOn Wednesday, Khalid Masood, a Muslim convert, rents a car in a town near Birmingham from an Enterprise rent-a-car shop sandwiched between a Staples and a beauty salon offering walk-in eyebrow waxing. Over a fifth of Birmingham is Muslim and by the time the bloodshed was over and Masood was in the hospital, police raided a flat over a restaurant advertising \u201cA Taste of Persia\u201d.\n\nBecause diversity is our strength.\n\nMasood\u2019s victims were certainly diverse. The men and women he ran over or pushed off Westminster Bridge included Brits, Americans, Romanians, Greeks, Chinese, South Koreans, Italians, Irish, Portuguese, Polish and French. That is the new form that diversity takes in the more multicultural cities.\n\nThe victims are diverse. The killers are Muslim.\n\nPrime Minister May spoke of it as a place where \u201cpeople of all nationalities and cultures gather to celebrate what it means to be free.\u201d But not all nationalities and cultures. Some come there to celebrate what it means to kill infidels for the greater glory of Allah. Just as some pray for London and others pray for the flag of Islam to fly over Westminster Palace.\n\nKhalid Masood, like Ziyed Ben Belgacem, had been in and out of prison. Like France\u2019s Tunisian Muslim terror settler, the UK\u2019s Muslim terror convert had been investigated for \u201cviolent extremism\u201d.\n\nNothing came of it.\n\nFor thirty years, Masood went in and out of prison. And one fine day he rented a car and began killing. He was on the radar, but nothing was done. And now some are dead and others are wounded. And the politicians who could have prevented it give their speeches and celebrate the magnificent diversity that filled hospitals with the citizens of a dozen nations.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, millions will be boarding trains and aeroplanes to travel to London, and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth,\u201d Prime Minister May declared, throwing in a pitch for tourism. \u201cIt is in these actions \u2013 millions of acts of normality \u2013 that we find the best response to terrorism.\u201d\n\nCome to London. Stroll and see the sights. You probably won\u2019t get Allahuakbared to death. And if you do, the best response is a million acts of normality, apathy and denial.\n\nMayor Sadiq Khan vowed that after a brief vigil, it would be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.\n\nHe was right.\n\nOn Thursday, Mohammed, a Tunisian Muslim tries to drive a car through a pedestrian mall on a major shopping street in Antwerp. It was right around the anniversary of the Brussels bombings in which Moroccan Muslim settler terrorists had killed 32 people and wounded 300.\n\nAnd a year later it was business as usual.\n\nOn Wednesday, King Philippe had dedicated a memorial in Brussels titled, \u2018Wounded But Still Standing in Front of the Inconceivable\u2019. \u201cWe have to stand up and say \u2018no\u2019 to those acts that are not believable, that are not bearable,\u201d its sculptor insisted.\n\nBut the seventh King of the Belgians had a somewhat different message. \u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of each and every one of us to make our society more humane, and more just. Let\u2019s learn to listen to each other again, to respect each other\u2019s weaknesses,\u201d he said. \u201cAbove all, let us dare to be tender.\u201d\n\nThe Tunisian Muslim driving into a pedestrian mall did not dare to be \u201ctender\u201d. He didn\u2019t respect the weaknesses of a society that tolerated him.\n\nBelgian soldiers deployed for the anniversary spotted him. The police gave chase. Pedestrians scurried out of the way. The Muslim settler from France was taken into custody for endangering the public. It is hoped that the arrest was made in a properly tender fashion.\n\nPolice found a riot gun, knives and fake passports in his car.\n\nThe Antwerp police chief said that Mohammed had been known to the police and had been involved in the illegal possession of weapons in France. But official reports blamed the drugs and alcohol in his system. Like fellow Tunisian Ziyed Ben Belgacem, he wasn\u2019t a terrorist, just a drunk and a junkie.\n\nThe police urged everyone to keep calm and return to normalcy. Everything was being done to ensure the safety of Antwerp residents and tourists.\n\nBusiness as usual.\n\nMeanwhile the Antwerp Town Hall had gone from flying British colors in solidarity with the victims of the London attack to worrying over an attack at home. Just as William and Kate had come from terror in France to terror at home.\n\nBritish authorities claimed that they foiled a dozen terror attacks last year. There are arrests for terror plots in France and Germany. Every week there is either a terror plot or a memorial for the last terror attack before we are told to go on with our million acts of normalcy.\n\nSome days the terrorists screw up. They pick what they think is an easy target, but she refuses to let go of the rifle. Or they overestimate how much alcohol and cocaine they need to nerve themselves up to kill and die. Other times they get it right. Or right enough. And the news flashes around the world.\n\nSomewhere along the way it wasn\u2019t life that became normal, but terror. And the insistence on normalcy just normalizes the terror. A week with three terror attacks across Europe is no longer extraordinary. We have come to expect that there will be men trying to stab and run us over from Paris to Antwerp to London. And we have come to expect another Islamic terror plot targeting Kansas City, Miami, Columbia, New York, San Bernardino, Boston, Tampa, Dallas, Rochester, Springfield and any city.\n\nWe don\u2019t know when or where the next attack will come. But we know whom it will come from.\n\nThe question is what are we going to do about it? We can pretend to be baffled the next time some Jihadi with a rap sheet taller than the London Eye and longer than London Bridge goes on a killing spree. We can nod our heads while the politicians throw a vigil and encourage a million acts of apathy.\n\nOr we can end the flow of future terrorists and deport the existing ones.\n\nBecause they can\u2019t run us over if we don\u2019t let them in. They can\u2019t bomb us if we don\u2019t let them stay.\n\nWe can listen to King Philippe and \u201cdare to be tender\u201d. Decades of such tenderness are what led us here. Or we can dare to make the hard choices that will make us and our children safe for generations.\n\nSaturday. Wednesday. Thursday. How many more days will it take?\n\nCourtesy of Sultan Knish\n\nh/t Freedom Outpost", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=584", "https://i2.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/170324145906-khalid-masood-mughsot-no-bars-super-169.jpg?fit=1100%2C619", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-02Uh91awYTk/WNgtysJzfKI/AAAAAAAAQHo/3mZmwK5iidEhuWnKAccIwGbPZukonmOpQCLcB/s320/170324145906-khalid-masood-mughsot-no-bars-super-169.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1"], "videos": []}
