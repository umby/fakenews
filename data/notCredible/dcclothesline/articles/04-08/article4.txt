Let&#8217;s examine footage never seen before in the West and the evidence regarding the latest chemical attack narrative from Syria to see who really is behind these alleged \u2018chemical <span id=\"more-71384\"></span>attacks\u2019.</p>\n<p>Firstly, let&#8217;s start with the politics. It was Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who has called on US President <a href=\"https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/4/5/trump-turns-against-assad-after-chemical-attack-atrocity-?utm_campaign=magnet&amp;utm_source=article_page&amp;utm_medium=related_articles\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Trump</a> to back up his harsh words against Syria with actions, following the <a href=\"https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/4/5/chemical-attack-evidence-of-syria-war-crimes\" target=\"_blank\">deadly chemical attack</a> this week that left scores of people, including children dead.</p>\n<p>\u201cTrump said it was impossible to close your eyes against the Assad regime\u2019s hateful actions. Thank you, but don\u2019t limit yourself to comments, we need action,\u201d Erdogan told Turkey\u2019s <em>Kanal 7</em> television.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it truly is a matter of actions, then Turkey is ready to take its responsibilities. We will not back down,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>It was former US president Barack Obama who had also warned Syria that chemical attacks in the country\u2019s civil war would cross a \u201cred line\u201d, but later refrained from taking military action against the regime.</p>\n<p>As we stated several times, in the U.S. parties change but foreign policy doesn\u2019t. So Trump complied to the Islamist\u2019s request from Turkey by sending cruise missiles which were fired from a U.S. Navy vessel in the Mediterranean Sea. Their target was the airfield which serves as the base for the warplanes suspected of carrying out the chemical attack.</p>\n<p>Two Republican senators are calling on President Donald Trump to take out Syria\u2019s air force as part of a swift and forceful response.</p>\n<p>\u201cHit this guy,\u201d Graham said of Assad. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my full permission.\u201d <a class=\"r_lapi\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/john-mccain.htm\">John McCain</a> of Arizona, who spoke to Trump on Wednesday, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement Thursday that Syrian President Bashar Assad \u201chas crossed a line\u201d and \u201cmust pay a punitive cost for this horrific attack.\u201d</p>\n<p>But what is the truth from the ground and what is going to be the results of all of this. Here, in Syria demonstrators that condemn the alleged chemical attack shout <em>Al-Sha\u2019b yurid Khilafa Islamiyeh</em>. English: \u201cthe people want an Islamic Caliphate\u201d:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/N-BW7yNbWIg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>But what is the truth behind this chemical attack that never circulates the western media that we obtained from Middle Eastern sources?</p>\n<p><em>Khan Sheikhoun</em>, where the attack happened was a hewn mountain with tunnels and impenetrable bunkers. Definitely a major hiding place for manufacturing weapon supplies for the Islamist rebels on a major scale. It is a \u201cwarehouse used to both produce and store shells containing toxic gas\u201d as Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said.</p>\n<p>Photos of the place and a video combines both scenes from the attack. The old previous footage from Qatari TV aired on Al-Jazeera TV shows the inside of this fortress which no western media covered reveals this is a major weapon manufacturing depot:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PHs7zTEPbWw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;start=228&amp;wmode=transparent\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ffb287d1d6132187cce295f5.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-110084\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ffb287d1d6132187cce295f5.jpg?resize=584%2C332\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ffb287d1d6132187cce295f5.jpg?resize=584%2C332 770w, http://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ffb287d1d6132187cce295f5-300x171.jpg 300w, http://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ffb287d1d6132187cce295f5-768x437.jpg 768w\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\n</a><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/khan-sheikhoun-syria-chemical-attack.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-110085\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/khan-sheikhoun-syria-chemical-attack.jpg?resize=584%2C361\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/khan-sheikhoun-syria-chemical-attack.jpg?resize=584%2C361 2560w, http://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/khan-sheikhoun-syria-chemical-attack-300x185.jpg 300w, http://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/khan-sheikhoun-syria-chemical-attack-768x475.jpg 768w, http://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/khan-sheikhoun-syria-chemical-attack-1024x633.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The warehouse was used to both produce and store shells containing toxic gas. John Gilbert, a senior science fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said the victims seen in video and photographs from Khan Sheikhoun \u201cshowed symptoms consistent with the nerve agent sarin.\u201d Doctors Without Borders, which supports medical clinics in rebel-held areas, said Wednesday that eight patients brought to Bab Al Hawa hospital, located near the Turkish border, had exhibited symptoms \u201cconsistent with exposure to a neurotoxic agent such as sarin gas or similar compounds.\u201d</p>\n<p>A number of opposition activists in Khan Sheikhoun said their groups had had no rebel weapons facilities, though the town has long been a target of government warplanes.</p>\n<p>However, Syrian journalist Nizar Nayouf <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-syria-chemical-attack-explainer-20170406-story.html\">quoted an unnamed doctor</a> who told him there had been a storage area for the rebels in town.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt contained a workshop \u2026 a section to store weapons and ammunition, and even foodstuffs and medical as well as logistical equipment,\u201d said Nayouf in a message on social media Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the old footage of the same place filmed by Qatari media which you have seen above reveals exactly that.</p>\n<p>Early U.S. assessments showed the use of chlorine gas and traces of the nerve agent sarin in the attack.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>But who is the U.S. defending in their retaliation on Syria\u2019s government and who is supplying these false narratives?</p>\n<p>They are defending Jaysh al-Islam (Arabic meaning <i>Army of Islam</i>), formerly known as Liwa al-Islam (Brigade of Islam). This is a coalition of Islamist and Salafist units involved in the Syrian Civil War. The group along with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ahrar ash-Sham\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahrar_ash-Sham\">Ahrar ash-Sham</a> are the main rebel groups supported by <a title=\"Saudi Arabia\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>.

It is possible however to have a coma because of the inhalation of chlorine gas and other chemicals.

The Syrian government has achieved significant gains, while its rebel adversaries are largely in disarray. It has taken back the cities of Aleppo and Homs, and was on the cusp of negotiating issues of aid and reconstruction with world powers under the aegis of the U.N. Assad was getting a clean slate. Why would Assad risk it all by carrying out a chemical attack?</p>\n<p>Or is it that the rebels were done with and they needed an ace from under Turkey\u2019s sleeve? In fact, <a href=\"http://shoebat.com/2017/03/28/the-us-military-is-now-deliberately-preventing-bashar-al-assad-and-his-troops-from-fighting-isis-while-at-the-same-time-supporting-muslim-rebels/\">just last week shoebat.com reported</a> on how the US military, working in conjunction with Islamic rebel forces, has been blocking Syrian troops from attacking ISIS-held territory. And now, a week later, the US attacks Syria. Coincidence? You decide. The same policies that were conducted in the last administration are being continued in the current one. Why? Because it&#8217;s part of a plan that was configured by the CIA all the way back in the 80s (more on this in a future article).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> <a href=\"http://shoebat.com/2014/02/15/american-government-plan-will-lead-annihilation-christians/\"><span class=\"s3\">As I wrote in 2014,</span></a> the taking out of Soviet-influenced leaders \u2014 such a Saddam \u2014 was planned out years in advance, before even George W. Bush was president. According to US Army General Wesley Clark, in 1991, Paul Wolfowitz told him that the US had 5-10 years to \u201cclean up those old Soviet client regimes, Syria, Iran, Iraq, before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us.\u201d </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Clinton was president when this plan was being discussed, and when Bush was in office, Saddam was toppled. Under Obama, Gaddafi and Mubarak were taken out, and the Assad regime was greatly diminished. Again, the change of presidency did not alter policy. We did a video to demonstrate that in America, presidents change, policy doesn\u2019t. </span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://shoebattube.com/player/embed_player.php?vid=1364&amp;width=660&amp;height=440&amp;autoplay=no\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://freedomoutpost.com/presidents-change-policy-doesnt-what-the-media-trump-admin-are-not-telling-you-about-the-chemical-attack-in-syria/\" target=\"_blank\">Freedom Outpost</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Article posted with permission from <a href=\"http://shoebat.com/2017/04/07/what-the-media-is-not-telling-you-about-who-is-behind-the-chemical-attack-muslim-rebels-were-behind-the-chemical-attack-and-now-the-us-government-is-using-it-to-justify-bombing-syria/\">Shoebat</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Walid Shoebat is a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was converted to Christianity, and author of the book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C0UQGLU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00C0UQGLU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=freedomoutpos-20\">God&#8217;s War on Terror</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Don't forget to follow the D.C.

Trump proves himself to be as much a international imperialist as the Presidents who preceded him. Surprise, surprise! And we should be asking ourselves, at who&#8217;s behest? Do you think Trump&#8217;s son in law Jared Kushner may have had something to do with this decision.</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;The power to declare war is a serious responsibility. Why were the framers so vague in defining the parameters of war and the conditions under which it could be declared? Section 8, Clause 11 is the only place of significance where warfare is mentioned in the Constitution. Little wonder this power has been abused. Luther Martin [one of Maryland&#8217;s delegates to the Constitutional Convention] protested: </p>\n<p>&#8216;\u2026the congress have also a power given them to raise and support armies, without any limitation as to numbers, and without any restriction in time of peace. Thus, sir, this plan of government, instead of guarding against a standing army, that engine of arbitrary power, which has so often and so successfully been used for the subversion of freedom, has in its formation given it an express and constitutional sanction\u2026.&#8217;40</p>\n<p>&#8220;John Quincy Adams predicted the consequences of America\u2019s international military entanglements: </p>\n<p>&#8216;America \u2026 has abstained from interference in the concerns of others, even when the conflict has been for principles to which she clings\u2026. Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions, and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy.\u2026 She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy and ambition, which assume the colors, and usurp the standard of freedom. The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force; the frontlet on her brow would no longer beam with the ineffable splendor of freedom and independence; but in its stead would soon be substituted an imperial diadem, flashing in false and tarnished luster, the murky radiance of dominion and power. She might become the dictatress of the world: she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.&#8217;41</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because the framers provided no Biblical parameters, unbiblical warfare has been the rule ever since. Following is a list of the countries bombed by the United States since World War II&#8230;.                     </p>\n<p>&#8220;From 1945 to the present [2012], the United States has bombed nineteen different countries under the guise of defending America\u2019s sovereignty and promoting democracy. But America is none the better for it, and not one of these countries has become a legitimate democracy \u2013 not that this would be anything to celebrate. Something is amiss. Wars fought for political gain or financial profit can only be classified as ungodly acts of aggression&#8230;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For more, see online Chapter 4 &#8220;Article 1: Legislative Usurpation&#8221;

Let\u2019s examine footage never seen before in the West and the evidence regarding the latest chemical attack narrative from Syria to see who really is behind these alleged \u2018chemical attacks\u2019.\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s start with the politics. It was Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who has called on US President Donald Trump to back up his harsh words against Syria with actions, following the deadly chemical attack this week that left scores of people, including children dead.\n\n\u201cTrump said it was impossible to close your eyes against the Assad regime\u2019s hateful actions. Thank you, but don\u2019t limit yourself to comments, we need action,\u201d Erdogan told Turkey\u2019s Kanal 7 television.\n\n\u201cIf it truly is a matter of actions, then Turkey is ready to take its responsibilities. We will not back down,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was former US president Barack Obama who had also warned Syria that chemical attacks in the country\u2019s civil war would cross a \u201cred line\u201d, but later refrained from taking military action against the regime.\n\nAs we stated several times, in the U.S. parties change but foreign policy doesn\u2019t. So Trump complied to the Islamist\u2019s request from Turkey by sending cruise missiles which were fired from a U.S. Navy vessel in the Mediterranean Sea. Their target was the airfield which serves as the base for the warplanes suspected of carrying out the chemical attack.\n\nTwo Republican senators are calling on President Donald Trump to take out Syria\u2019s air force as part of a swift and forceful response.\n\n\u201cHit this guy,\u201d Graham said of Assad. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my full permission.\u201d John McCain of Arizona, who spoke to Trump on Wednesday, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement Thursday that Syrian President Bashar Assad \u201chas crossed a line\u201d and \u201cmust pay a punitive cost for this horrific attack.\u201d\n\nBut what is the truth from the ground and what is going to be the results of all of this. Here, in Syria demonstrators that condemn the alleged chemical attack shout Al-Sha\u2019b yurid Khilafa Islamiyeh. English: \u201cthe people want an Islamic Caliphate\u201d:\n\nBut what is the truth behind this chemical attack that never circulates the western media that we obtained from Middle Eastern sources?\n\nKhan Sheikhoun, where the attack happened was a hewn mountain with tunnels and impenetrable bunkers. Definitely a major hiding place for manufacturing weapon supplies for the Islamist rebels on a major scale. It is a \u201cwarehouse used to both produce and store shells containing toxic gas\u201d as Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said.\n\nPhotos of the place and a video combines both scenes from the attack. The old previous footage from Qatari TV aired on Al-Jazeera TV shows the inside of this fortress which no western media covered reveals this is a major weapon manufacturing depot:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe warehouse was used to both produce and store shells containing toxic gas. John Gilbert, a senior science fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said the victims seen in video and photographs from Khan Sheikhoun \u201cshowed symptoms consistent with the nerve agent sarin.\u201d Doctors Without Borders, which supports medical clinics in rebel-held areas, said Wednesday that eight patients brought to Bab Al Hawa hospital, located near the Turkish border, had exhibited symptoms \u201cconsistent with exposure to a neurotoxic agent such as sarin gas or similar compounds.\u201d\n\nA number of opposition activists in Khan Sheikhoun said their groups had had no rebel weapons facilities, though the town has long been a target of government warplanes.\n\nHowever, Syrian journalist Nizar Nayouf quoted an unnamed doctor who told him there had been a storage area for the rebels in town.\n\n\u201cIt contained a workshop \u2026 a section to store weapons and ammunition, and even foodstuffs and medical as well as logistical equipment,\u201d said Nayouf in a message on social media Wednesday.\n\nIndeed, the old footage of the same place filmed by Qatari media which you have seen above reveals exactly that.\n\nEarly U.S. assessments showed the use of chlorine gas and traces of the nerve agent sarin in the attack.\n\nBut who is the U.S. defending in their retaliation on Syria\u2019s government and who is supplying these false narratives?\n\nThey are defending Jaysh al-Islam (Arabic meaning Army of Islam), formerly known as Liwa al-Islam (Brigade of Islam). This is a coalition of Islamist and Salafist units involved in the Syrian Civil War. The group along with Ahrar ash-Sham are the main rebel groups supported by Saudi Arabia. Liwa al-Islam was established by Zahran Alloush, the son of Saudi-based religious scholar Mohammed Alloush who is currently residing in Turkey and is aided by it.\n\nOne clue that reveal these knew of the attack prior to it happening was that Alloush blundered a tweet showing about the types of symptoms caused by the gas claiming it caused \u201cheart failure for five hours\u201d. It is possible however to have a coma because of the inhalation of chlorine gas and other chemicals. How he knew what chemical agent was used before any investigation remains a mystery.\n\n\u063a\u062f\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u062d\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u062a\u063a\u0637\u064a\u0629 \u0643\u062b\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0631\u064a\u0641 #\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0645 #\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0648\u0631_\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u062d\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0646\u064a\u064a\u0646.#\u0631\u064a\u0641_\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0629_\u064a\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0642 \u2014 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u0643\u0631\u0645 \u2013 \u0645\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0644 \ud83d\udcfa (@feraskaram01) April 4, 2017\n\nAlso, another source of these leaked reports is the social media accounts of Syrian propaganda journalist Feras Karam, who writes for the Syrian oppositionist website Orient News. Karam before the day of the attack tweeted all journalists to prep for the major media campaign to expose Syria\u2019s use of chemical attacks. How would he have known of an impending attack prior to the event remains a mystery.\n\nText of the tweet states \u201ctomorrow is the campaign coverage the extent of the air raids in Hama and the use of poisonous chlorine against civilians\u201d Dated April 3, 7:06 PM. This was definitely before when the chemical incident happened.\n\nAll this plus other reports reveal Turkey was involved:\n\n\n\nSyria reject allegations of using chemical arms by presstv\n\nSo now we come to the million dollar question that no serious \u2018analyst\u2019 can answer. The Syrian government has achieved significant gains, while its rebel adversaries are largely in disarray. It has taken back the cities of Aleppo and Homs, and was on the cusp of negotiating issues of aid and reconstruction with world powers under the aegis of the U.N. Assad was getting a clean slate. Why would Assad risk it all by carrying out a chemical attack?\n\nOr is it that the rebels were done with and they needed an ace from under Turkey\u2019s sleeve? In fact, just last week shoebat.com reported on how the US military, working in conjunction with Islamic rebel forces, has been blocking Syrian troops from attacking ISIS-held territory. And now, a week later, the US attacks Syria. Coincidence? You decide. The same policies that were conducted in the last administration are being continued in the current one. Why? Because it\u2019s part of a plan that was configured by the CIA all the way back in the 80s (more on this in a future article).\n\nAs I wrote in 2014, the taking out of Soviet-influenced leaders \u2014 such a Saddam \u2014 was planned out years in advance, before even George W. Bush was president. According to US Army General Wesley Clark, in 1991, Paul Wolfowitz told him that the US had 5-10 years to \u201cclean up those old Soviet client regimes, Syria, Iran, Iraq, before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us.\u201d\n\nClinton was president when this plan was being discussed, and when Bush was in office, Saddam was toppled. Under Obama, Gaddafi and Mubarak were taken out, and the Assad regime was greatly diminished. Again, the change of presidency did not alter policy. We did a video to demonstrate that in America, presidents change, policy doesn\u2019t.\n\nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost\n\nArticle posted with permission from Shoebat\n\nWalid Shoebat is a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was converted to Christianity, and author of the book, God\u2019s War on Terror.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/khan-sheikhoun-syria-chemical-attack.jpg?resize=584%2C361", "https://i2.wp.com/shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ffb287d1d6132187cce295f5.jpg?resize=584%2C332", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/khan-sheikhoun-syria-chemical-attack.jpg?fit=1200%2C742", "https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=584"], "videos": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/N-BW7yNbWIg?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/PHs7zTEPbWw?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&start=228&wmode=transparent", "http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x5hc7n8?start=15"]}
