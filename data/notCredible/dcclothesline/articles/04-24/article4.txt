First, the man on a rant, Farid Smahi, who was hauled away from Anne Hidalgo yesterday as she left the Marks &amp; Spencer store where terrorist Karim Cheurfi was gunned down by police, referenced the most famous case of malpractice of French jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>From the translator, Ava-Lon:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Farid is using the expression J\u2019accuse which entered in the French language about 120 years ago during the cause of Dreyfus.</p>\n<p>Dreyfus was a Jewish officer in the French army who was tried for treason (in favor of Germans, who France was fighting at that moment) in 1894 in an atmosphere of prejudice and where evidence against him was fabricated.</p>\n<p>\u201cJ\u2019accuse\u201d was an open letter of French writer Emile Zola, published in January 1898,concerning the case of Dreyfus, where Zola was accusing French government of antisemitism, bias, and unlawful jailing of Alfred Dreyfus. For that letter Zola was himself prosecuted for libel and found guilty in February 1898. He had to exile himself to England to avoid imprisonment. He returned to France the following year and continued his defense of Dreyfus, who was retired the same year, found guilty again, but was pardoned (all seems to point to the government trying to save face).</p>\n<p>Only in 1906, on appeal, Dreyfus obtain annulment of his guilty verdict and even awarded the Legion d\u2019honneur the highest French media (with mention \u201cfor a soldier who has endured an unparalleled martyrdom\u201d).</p>\n<p>The expression \u201cJ\u2019accuse\u201d since became the call of everyone who is fighting greater power. Even if Farid wasn\u2019t aware of the exact case he sure used the expression well.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, is a well known leftist and muslim sympathizer.</p>\n<p>In fact she is creating legal and financial problems for an excellent French counter-jihad site because they did a <a href=\"http://ripostelaique.com/anne-hidalgo-je-suis-charlie-mais-je-porte-plainte-contre-ce-dessin-de-ri7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mocking caricature of her</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://littlenotesfromparis.blogspot.com/2015/11/paris-terror-taste-of-palestine.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oz-Rita</a> adds the following about Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris:</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>She came to politics via Francois Hollande. At the time the now (still) French President was still living with the mother of his 4 children, Segolene Royal, and it was reported that the latter was very unhappy about their \u201crelationship\u201d and did not like Hidalgo.\u201d</p>\n<p>When some Saudi was \u201coffended\u201d by some French writer and sued him, she took the side of the Saudi etc. she is a nasty piece of \u2018work\u2019</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Transcript video #1:</strong></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">00:00</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">It\u2019s you who have created those S-files [terrorist files].</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">00:04</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">You should arrest them! \u2014Stop it! \u2014Let go!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">00:08</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Take it easy, I told you, sir! \u2014Criminal government! \u2014Calm down, calm down!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">00:12</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Criminals, criminals! \u2014Calm down, sir, I told you, calm down, sir! \u2014 They\u2019re coming to parade here!</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">00:16</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Calm down, sir, please, OK?

The man, who has been identified as former regional councillor Farod Smahi, had to be hauled away from Anne Hidalgo yesterday as she left the Marks & Spencer store where terrorist Karim Cheurfi was gunned down by police on Thursday night. Cheurfi, 39, drove his silver Audi on to the Champs Elysee, the most famous street in the French capital, and \u2018targeted\u2019 officers using a Kalashnikov on Thursday night. The ISIS fanatic killed 37-year-old policeman Xavier Jugele as he sat in a patrol van at a red light and hit another police officer in the chest, but he survived because he was wearing a bulletproof vest. Cheurfi then tried to run away with his rifle and wounded a third officer before being gunned down near a Marks & Spencer store on the world-famous avenue. Mr Smahi claimed that terrorism had not been discussed during debates for the upcoming Presidential election until Thursday\u2019s attack, and accused Ms Hidalgo of only coming to the Champs Elysee as a publicity stunt. In particular, he vocally slammed France\u2019s controversial \u2018S-Card\u2019 system, which is designed to flag up individuals who pose a potential terror threat but has been widely criticised for its ineffectiveness. He said, \u2018Not one candidate spoke about the dead in Nice, the Bataclan, and still it continues. \u2018But now, yesterday, they all opened their big mouths. It\u2019s because they\u2019re pandering to the Muslims of France. \u2018I was a Muslim, I\u2019m not anymore. I\u2019m ashamed.\u2019 \u201cTHERE IS NO MORE FRENCH, THERE IS NOTHING ANYMORE!\u201d\n\nTepes includes this on the first video:\n\nEx-Muslim in Paris gives the Mayor a piece of his mind This is quite a clip and has a couple of cultural references that need adding. First, the man on a rant, Farid Smahi, who was hauled away from Anne Hidalgo yesterday as she left the Marks & Spencer store where terrorist Karim Cheurfi was gunned down by police, referenced the most famous case of malpractice of French jurisprudence. From the translator, Ava-Lon: Farid is using the expression J\u2019accuse which entered in the French language about 120 years ago during the cause of Dreyfus. Dreyfus was a Jewish officer in the French army who was tried for treason (in favor of Germans, who France was fighting at that moment) in 1894 in an atmosphere of prejudice and where evidence against him was fabricated. \u201cJ\u2019accuse\u201d was an open letter of French writer Emile Zola, published in January 1898,concerning the case of Dreyfus, where Zola was accusing French government of antisemitism, bias, and unlawful jailing of Alfred Dreyfus. For that letter Zola was himself prosecuted for libel and found guilty in February 1898. He had to exile himself to England to avoid imprisonment. He returned to France the following year and continued his defense of Dreyfus, who was retired the same year, found guilty again, but was pardoned (all seems to point to the government trying to save face). Only in 1906, on appeal, Dreyfus obtain annulment of his guilty verdict and even awarded the Legion d\u2019honneur the highest French media (with mention \u201cfor a soldier who has endured an unparalleled martyrdom\u201d). The expression \u201cJ\u2019accuse\u201d since became the call of everyone who is fighting greater power. Even if Farid wasn\u2019t aware of the exact case he sure used the expression well. Also the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, is a well known leftist and muslim sympathizer. In fact she is creating legal and financial problems for an excellent French counter-jihad site because they did a mocking caricature of her. Oz-Rita adds the following about Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris: She came to politics via Francois Hollande. At the time the now (still) French President was still living with the mother of his 4 children, Segolene Royal, and it was reported that the latter was very unhappy about their \u201crelationship\u201d and did not like Hidalgo.\u201d When some Saudi was \u201coffended\u201d by some French writer and sued him, she took the side of the Saudi etc. she is a nasty piece of \u2018work\u2019 Transcript video #1: 00:00 It\u2019s you who have created those S-files [terrorist files]. 00:04 You should arrest them! \u2014Stop it! \u2014Let go! 00:08 Take it easy, I told you, sir! \u2014Criminal government! \u2014Calm down, calm down! 00:12 Criminals, criminals! \u2014Calm down, sir, I told you, calm down, sir! \u2014 They\u2019re coming to parade here! 00:16 Calm down, sir, please, OK?

I\u2019m ashamed, I\u2019m ashamed.\u2019 France goes to the polls tomorrow in the first round of its presidential elections, with the nation reeling from Thursday\u2019s attack. ISIS immediately claimed responsibility for the incident and Cheurfi was known to the authorities because he had a long string of police-hating convictions. Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo leaves flowers at the scene where policeman Xavier Jugele was fatally shot Mr Smahi labelled Ms Hidalgo \u2013 who has been mayor since 2014 \u2013 and other politicians as \u2018criminals\u2019 He was jailed for 20 years after trying to kill officers in 2001 but prosecutors tonight denied Cheurfi was on a security watch list and added he showed no signs of radicalisation before the attack. French officials revealed that Cheurfi was detained in Meaux, 24 miles east of Paris, on February 23 this year, after it emerged he was trying to buy weapons \u2018to kill police\u2019. He was let go in March due to lack of evidence. French security services are under immense pressure as they face troubling questions as to how they failed to prevent him from carrying out the attack. Details of Cheurfi\u2019s terrifying career as a determined criminal was outlined by Paris prosecutor Francois Molins during a press conference in the capital city on Friday evening. Mr Molins said: \u2018Karim Cheurfi was known to the police and the judiciary. In the course of 2017, he sought to obtain weapons and made statements suggesting that he wanted to kill policemen.\u2019 Referring to a commuter town north east of Paris, Mr Molins said: \u2018The prosecutor\u2019s office in Meaux opened a preliminary investigation on 13 January 2017.\n\nPamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration\u2019s War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/22/11/3F77BFF100000578-4434914-image-a-30_1492856248919.jpg?resize=634%2C423", "https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=640", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/3F7B9BE500000578-4434914-Farod_Smahi_had_to_be_hauled_away_from_Anne_Hidalgo_as_she_left_-a-24_1492854779824.jpg?fit=634%2C355", "https://i1.wp.com/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/22/10/3F7B9BE100000578-4434914-Mr_Smahi_accused_Ms_Hidalgo_of_only_coming_to_the_Champs_Elysee_-a-23_1492854772564.jpg?resize=634%2C364", "https://i0.wp.com/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/22/10/3F7B9BD100000578-4434914-Mr_Smahi_claimed_that_terrorism_had_not_been_discussed_during_de-a-21_1492854758785.jpg?resize=634%2C356", "https://i2.wp.com/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/22/10/3F7B9BE900000578-4434914-He_vocally_slammed_France_s_controversial_S_Card_system_which_is-a-22_1492854764677.jpg?resize=634%2C348", "https://i2.wp.com/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/22/11/3F77C0A600000578-4434914-image-a-28_1492856228784.jpg?resize=634%2C423", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/images/rss/orange-medium.png", "https://i2.wp.com/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/22/10/3F7B9BE500000578-4434914-Farod_Smahi_had_to_be_hauled_away_from_Anne_Hidalgo_as_she_left_-a-24_1492854779824.jpg?resize=634%2C355"], "videos": []}
