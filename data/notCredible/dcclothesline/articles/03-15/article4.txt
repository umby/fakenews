In reality, the inner <span id=\"more-70555\"></span>workings of US policy resemble nothing of the sort.</p>\n<p>In reality, an unelected deep state controls the United States, its resources, government, and people. However, the term \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/03/04/attorney-claims-obama-encouraged-de-facto-coup-against-trump-by-deep-state/\" target=\"_blank\">deep state</a>\u201d has been overused and intentionally abused, particularly since the election of US President Donald Trump in an effort to continue concealing the real deep state and divert public attention away from what is becoming an increasingly obvious continuity of agenda from one presidency to the next.</p>\n<p>Uncovering and understanding the nature of the real deep state is in fact elementary, but essential in understanding the genesis and perpetuation of US policy. It is also essential in formulating solutions aimed at reining in the unwarranted power and influence wielded by this seemingly nebulous entity.</p>\n<div class=\"sb-widget clearfix\"></div>\n<h2><strong>Identifying the Real Deep State is Easy</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite the myth of \u201cdemocracy,\u201d real power is held by those who control the essentials of any given state, province, district, or community. Essentials include control over monetary instruments, essential infrastructure such as water, power, communication, and transportation, control over manufacturing, healthcare, and basic public services, as well as more obvious forms of power such as control over police and military forces.</p>\n<p>In rare instances, such vital essentials are controlled by decentralized, grassroots organizations \u2013 and in these instances deep states are either weak or virtually nonexistent. However, more often than not, this is not the case \u2013 at least not yet.</p>\n<p>The concept of a \u201cdeep state\u201d is not unique to only the US. Virtually every nation and throughout all of human history, regardless of a nation\u2019s alleged political proclivities, has been ruled by wealthy and influential special interests either directly or by proxy.Ordinarily, regardless of apparent, ongoing political processes, those who actually, truly control these essentials often exist well beyond but not out of reach of politics. They include large corporations and financial institutions. Organizations, lobbyists, media platforms, think tanks, and political parties are set up and controlled by these special interests to then project their power and influence into or entirely driving any given political process.</p>\n<p>Ignoring political rhetoric and charades, and focusing on where money, power, and influence truly resides, reveals the real deep state.</p>\n<h2><strong>Unraveling the \u201cTrump Vs Deep State\u201d Narrative</strong></h2>\n<p>A cursory examination of President Trump\u2019s administration reveals that he is but one of many extensions of the real deep state. Allegedly \u201calternative\u201d <em>Breitbart News</em> mogul Stephen Bannon who functions as President Trump\u2019s chief strategist is in fact a former Goldman Sachs banker. US Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, is also a former Goldman Sachs banker. Additionally, he managed funds for alleged \u201cTrump archenemy,\u201d George Soros, and had invested in the presidential campaigns of both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, is a long-time ExxonMobil executive, and the list goes on.</p>\n<p class=\"m_2538351138156071778gmail-separator\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/-pbuDazrzeqc/WMJJYbbMLFI/AAAAAAAAPds/omg0dm0fzO0w6LgrQbUTW4FE3S7GBRd9QCLcB/s1600/Trumps_Swamp.jpg?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pbuDazrzeqc/WMJJYbbMLFI/AAAAAAAAPds/omg0dm0fzO0w6LgrQbUTW4FE3S7GBRd9QCLcB/s1600/Trumps_Swamp.jpg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1489496037743000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUUtNV6AbzERj1hmUriM0tB9MXjw\"><img class=\"CToWUd aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/-pbuDazrzeqc/WMJJYbbMLFI/AAAAAAAAPds/omg0dm0fzO0w6LgrQbUTW4FE3S7GBRd9QCLcB/s640/Trumps_Swamp.jpg?resize=640%2C452&#038;ssl=1\" border=\"0\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>If one were to map the flow of US power and influence globally, tracing it back to its source, they would find themselves on Wall Street and in the boardrooms of financial institutions and corporations like Goldman Sachs and ExxonMobil. They would also find, leading out from these boardrooms, proxy news platforms like <em>Breitbart News</em> aimed at manipulating, distracting, and preying on the emotions of the American public.</p>\n<p>In other words, in reality, the Trump administration, like those of previous presidencies, is the embodiment of the deep state.</p>\n<p>However, a narrative has emerged alleging that President Trump is actually at war with a shadowy \u201cdeep state\u201d consisting of everything from the US intelligence community to career bureaucrats \u201cresisting\u201d the Trump administration and \u201cits\u201d policies from within the system.</p>\n<p>To explain this contrived narrative to the American public, another one of the real deep state\u2019s propaganda functionaries, <em>TIME Magazine</em>, punished an article titled, \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/4692178/donald-trump-deep-state-breitbart-barack-obama/\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://time.com/4692178/donald-trump-deep-state-breitbart-barack-obama/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1489496037743000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF9Fx0YEfVCdsXqKZJdpZjqDMQR8Q\">President Trump\u2019s Allies Keep Talking About the \u2018Deep State.\u2019 What\u2019s That?</a>\u201d</p>\n<p>In it, it claims:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"m_2538351138156071778gmail-tr_bq\"><p>To allies of Trump in the conservative media and on Capitol Hill, it is an organized resistance within the government, working to subvert his presidency. They blame career bureaucrats, many of whom they see as loyal to former President Barack Obama, for leaking damaging information to the news media.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>TIME</em> also cites Freedom House, a US government-funded organization dedicated to regime change worldwide and chaired by the very same special interested centered upon Wall Street \u2013 again, the actual, real deep state \u2013 in an effort to downplay and dismiss the notion that the United States is actually run by just such an entity.</p>\n<p>It claims:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"m_2538351138156071778gmail-tr_bq\"><p>\u201c[The White House] is taking a sexy term that means something very real in an environment in which there has been a lot of violence associated with this term and we\u2019re applying it to stuff that\u2019s pretty normal in terms of a large bureaucracy,\u201d said Schenkaan, the Freedom House project director. \u201cThese are state employees and they have been implementing their jobs faithfully for a long time.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Back in reality, the American public is beginning to suspect in much larger numbers than ever before, that the US government is simply carrying out a singular agenda \u2013 regardless of election results and political affiliations \u2013 of a permanent, deeply rooted conglomeration of special interests that transcend political parties, ideologies, presidential terms, as well as both domestic and international law.</p>\n<div class=\"m_2538351138156071778gmail-separator\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-WAA5IJov3ig/WMJJljXNouI/AAAAAAAAPdw/N-g__JZC8XYuUlshb_1PoYeDgEdcB3nvgCLcB/s1600/ThinkTanks_2.jpg?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WAA5IJov3ig/WMJJljXNouI/AAAAAAAAPdw/N-g__JZC8XYuUlshb_1PoYeDgEdcB3nvgCLcB/s1600/ThinkTanks_2.jpg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1489496037743000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKdNRiyjWiZoyWQRrBD45vRTmEMQ\"><img class=\"CToWUd aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-WAA5IJov3ig/WMJJljXNouI/AAAAAAAAPdw/N-g__JZC8XYuUlshb_1PoYeDgEdcB3nvgCLcB/s640/ThinkTanks_2.jpg?resize=640%2C452&#038;ssl=1\" border=\"0\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></div>\n<p>The creation of an attractive, provocative, almost irresistible strategy of tension between various functionaries within the real deep state is intentionally designed to draw in and trap political discourse long before it reaches and reveals the true nature of both the real deep state and the solutions required to dismantle it.</p>\n<h2><strong>America\u2019s Deep State is the World\u2019s Problem</strong></h2>\n<p>It is beyond obvious that America\u2019s real deep state represents not only the usurpation of American sovereignty, but also a threat to global peace and stability. The wielding of America\u2019s unwarranted power and influence manifests itself as regional wars, subsequent waves of refugees, socioeconomic exploitation and catastrophe within targeted states and across entire regions, as well as a general global malaise resulting from a minute handful of special interests abusing and egregiously wasting the planet\u2019s human and natural resources for its own petty, self-serving pursuits.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>It is not, then, an American problem, because the consequences of America\u2019s unchecked deep state stretch out across the entire globe.</p>\n<p>Confronting this deep state, and all others like it regardless of size and reach, requires a careful transition pursued by lesser states \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 by modern, decentralized institutions and alternatives driven by individuals.</p>\n<p>Confronting the real deep state at the very source of its power \u2013 its corporate and financial activities and the profits reaped from billions of people across the planet paying into them \u2013 is fundamental.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of doing so is already evident in such realms as information space where decentralized networks of genuine alternative news platforms have countered and overcome the real deep state\u2019s information war capabilities. Adding leverage to this process are competing centers of global power in Eurasia who have created competing media platforms that have further diluted the US deep state\u2019s grip on information.</p>\n<p>A similar process \u2013 enabled by technology \u2013 is unfolding across all aspects of manufacturing and infrastructure. The emergence of aerospace industries across the developing world is beginning to challenge the US-European monopoly over both air and space. Chinese corporations building trains and aircraft \u2013 on the largest end of the spectrum \u2013 are diluting monopolies enjoyed for decades by corporations like Boeing and Airbus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/-GydzuAQcrm4/WMJJ8EKYzeI/AAAAAAAAPd4/SnNPAeBzdKoWojfZE9MKnnnvMRjsb45QgCLcB/s1600/China_ARJ-21.jpg?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GydzuAQcrm4/WMJJ8EKYzeI/AAAAAAAAPd4/SnNPAeBzdKoWojfZE9MKnnnvMRjsb45QgCLcB/s1600/China_ARJ-21.jpg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1489496037743000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFds3rPp7yRpCAGw21tbaGcByRkww\"><img class=\"CToWUd aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/-GydzuAQcrm4/WMJJ8EKYzeI/AAAAAAAAPd4/SnNPAeBzdKoWojfZE9MKnnnvMRjsb45QgCLcB/s640/China_ARJ-21.jpg?resize=640%2C426&#038;ssl=1\" border=\"0\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a>On the smaller end of the spectrum, localized manufacturing of simpler goods carried out by individuals or small businesses, both within formal and informal economies and markets, are chipping away at centralized manufacturing and retail monopolies.</p>\n<p>Alternative energy such as solar power lends itself well to decentralized power production both for individuals and members of networks known as microgrids. As these microgrids proliferate, energy monopolies will inevitably whither.</p>\n<p>And the organic food movement \u2013 a mesh network that continues to expand by leaps and bound in both size and capabilities \u2013 has challenged and in some instances, entirely replaced centralized agricultural and processing monopolies who also constitute the membership of the US deep state.</p>\n<h2><strong>Solving the Deep State Problem</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite this, the deep state still poses a formidable and dangerous threat to both global and individual peace and prosperity.</p>\n<p>The natural human inclination to create alternatives to compete with such a threat \u2013 but which simply resemble a mirrored version of the threat \u2013 means that a \u201cChinese\u201d or \u201cRussian\u201d dominated deep state leading any given unipolar global order will simply replace America\u2019s immense deep state and continue carrying on the abuses and destructive role Wall Street and Washington currently fulfill.</p>\n<p>Talk of a multipolar world order in which nations balance themselves against one another rather than fall under a single, unipolar order dominated by a single deep state and the handful of interests that constitute it, forms a bridge between today\u2019s current global order and a decentralized, balanced future.</p>\n<p>A multipolar world order in which nations are balanced globally, then leads to an internal process of decentralization and balance, all of which is driven by technology and the opportunities in business and sociopolitical pursuits opened up by it which allow each individual to take a more proportional share of a nation\u2019s or community\u2019s resources.</p>\n<p>While it may seem counterintiutive for nations like Russia, India, or China, or even smaller players like Iran, Thailand, or Brazil to invest in decentralization, national and local self-sufficiency, and even informal economies, currencies, and markets, by doing so, they help chip away at the current, dominate global deep state which through its media and consumerism still reaches into, threatens, and influences virtually every society on Earth.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, sidestepping the crass, unsophisticated but highly provocative and alluring strategy of tension created around the Trump administration and the alleged \u201cdeep state\u201d it is supposedly fighting, is essential in identifying and confronting the real deep state that is orchestrating both sides of this charade.</p>\n<p>Placing stock in political functionaries of the deep state to solve the deep state problem is beyond futile \u2013 it is a ruse intentionally engineered to preserve and perpetuate the deep state. By identifying the true source of the real deep state\u2019s power and influence \u2013 the wealth it derives from its corporate-financier monopolies, its control over national and international infrastructure, and its media \u2013 we can begin devising practical alternatives to dilute these monopolies and thus the power and influence they grant those who control them.</p>\n<p>It requires a period of transition involving both state and individual efforts pursued by all who stand threatened by the deep state \u2013 and all those who are threatened by the deep state consist of anyone who resides outside the boardrooms from within which its agenda is devised and implemented.</p>\n<p><em>Tony Cartalucci, Bangkok-based geopolitical researcher and writer, especially for the online magazine <a href=\"http://journal-neo.org/\">\u201cNew Eastern Outlook,\u201d</a> where this article <a href=\"http://journal-neo.org/2017/03/13/exposing-the-real-deep-state/\">first appeared</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2017/03/exposing-real-deep-state.html\" target=\"_blank\">Activist Post</a></em></p>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Don't forget to follow the D.C.

In reality, the inner workings of US policy resemble nothing of the sort.\n\nIn reality, an unelected deep state controls the United States, its resources, government, and people. However, the term \u201cdeep state\u201d has been overused and intentionally abused, particularly since the election of US President Donald Trump in an effort to continue concealing the real deep state and divert public attention away from what is becoming an increasingly obvious continuity of agenda from one presidency to the next.\n\nUncovering and understanding the nature of the real deep state is in fact elementary, but essential in understanding the genesis and perpetuation of US policy. It is also essential in formulating solutions aimed at reining in the unwarranted power and influence wielded by this seemingly nebulous entity.\n\nIdentifying the Real Deep State is Easy\n\nDespite the myth of \u201cdemocracy,\u201d real power is held by those who control the essentials of any given state, province, district, or community. Essentials include control over monetary instruments, essential infrastructure such as water, power, communication, and transportation, control over manufacturing, healthcare, and basic public services, as well as more obvious forms of power such as control over police and military forces.\n\nIn rare instances, such vital essentials are controlled by decentralized, grassroots organizations \u2013 and in these instances deep states are either weak or virtually nonexistent. However, more often than not, this is not the case \u2013 at least not yet.\n\nThe concept of a \u201cdeep state\u201d is not unique to only the US. Virtually every nation and throughout all of human history, regardless of a nation\u2019s alleged political proclivities, has been ruled by wealthy and influential special interests either directly or by proxy.Ordinarily, regardless of apparent, ongoing political processes, those who actually, truly control these essentials often exist well beyond but not out of reach of politics. They include large corporations and financial institutions. Organizations, lobbyists, media platforms, think tanks, and political parties are set up and controlled by these special interests to then project their power and influence into or entirely driving any given political process.\n\nIgnoring political rhetoric and charades, and focusing on where money, power, and influence truly resides, reveals the real deep state.\n\nUnraveling the \u201cTrump Vs Deep State\u201d Narrative\n\nA cursory examination of President Trump\u2019s administration reveals that he is but one of many extensions of the real deep state. Allegedly \u201calternative\u201d Breitbart News mogul Stephen Bannon who functions as President Trump\u2019s chief strategist is in fact a former Goldman Sachs banker. US Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, is also a former Goldman Sachs banker. Additionally, he managed funds for alleged \u201cTrump archenemy,\u201d George Soros, and had invested in the presidential campaigns of both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, is a long-time ExxonMobil executive, and the list goes on.\n\nIf one were to map the flow of US power and influence globally, tracing it back to its source, they would find themselves on Wall Street and in the boardrooms of financial institutions and corporations like Goldman Sachs and ExxonMobil. They would also find, leading out from these boardrooms, proxy news platforms like Breitbart News aimed at manipulating, distracting, and preying on the emotions of the American public.\n\nIn other words, in reality, the Trump administration, like those of previous presidencies, is the embodiment of the deep state.\n\nHowever, a narrative has emerged alleging that President Trump is actually at war with a shadowy \u201cdeep state\u201d consisting of everything from the US intelligence community to career bureaucrats \u201cresisting\u201d the Trump administration and \u201cits\u201d policies from within the system.\n\nTo explain this contrived narrative to the American public, another one of the real deep state\u2019s propaganda functionaries, TIME Magazine, punished an article titled, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Allies Keep Talking About the \u2018Deep State.\u2019 What\u2019s That?\u201d\n\nIn it, it claims:\n\nTo allies of Trump in the conservative media and on Capitol Hill, it is an organized resistance within the government, working to subvert his presidency. They blame career bureaucrats, many of whom they see as loyal to former President Barack Obama, for leaking damaging information to the news media.\n\nTIME also cites Freedom House, a US government-funded organization dedicated to regime change worldwide and chaired by the very same special interested centered upon Wall Street \u2013 again, the actual, real deep state \u2013 in an effort to downplay and dismiss the notion that the United States is actually run by just such an entity.\n\nIt claims:\n\n\u201c[The White House] is taking a sexy term that means something very real in an environment in which there has been a lot of violence associated with this term and we\u2019re applying it to stuff that\u2019s pretty normal in terms of a large bureaucracy,\u201d said Schenkaan, the Freedom House project director. \u201cThese are state employees and they have been implementing their jobs faithfully for a long time.\u201d\n\nBack in reality, the American public is beginning to suspect in much larger numbers than ever before, that the US government is simply carrying out a singular agenda \u2013 regardless of election results and political affiliations \u2013 of a permanent, deeply rooted conglomeration of special interests that transcend political parties, ideologies, presidential terms, as well as both domestic and international law.\n\nThe creation of an attractive, provocative, almost irresistible strategy of tension between various functionaries within the real deep state is intentionally designed to draw in and trap political discourse long before it reaches and reveals the true nature of both the real deep state and the solutions required to dismantle it.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Deep State is the World\u2019s Problem\n\nIt is beyond obvious that America\u2019s real deep state represents not only the usurpation of American sovereignty, but also a threat to global peace and stability. The wielding of America\u2019s unwarranted power and influence manifests itself as regional wars, subsequent waves of refugees, socioeconomic exploitation and catastrophe within targeted states and across entire regions, as well as a general global malaise resulting from a minute handful of special interests abusing and egregiously wasting the planet\u2019s human and natural resources for its own petty, self-serving pursuits.\n\nIt is not, then, an American problem, because the consequences of America\u2019s unchecked deep state stretch out across the entire globe.\n\nConfronting this deep state, and all others like it regardless of size and reach, requires a careful transition pursued by lesser states \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 by modern, decentralized institutions and alternatives driven by individuals.\n\nConfronting the real deep state at the very source of its power \u2013 its corporate and financial activities and the profits reaped from billions of people across the planet paying into them \u2013 is fundamental.\n\nThe effectiveness of doing so is already evident in such realms as information space where decentralized networks of genuine alternative news platforms have countered and overcome the real deep state\u2019s information war capabilities. Adding leverage to this process are competing centers of global power in Eurasia who have created competing media platforms that have further diluted the US deep state\u2019s grip on information.\n\nA similar process \u2013 enabled by technology \u2013 is unfolding across all aspects of manufacturing and infrastructure. The emergence of aerospace industries across the developing world is beginning to challenge the US-European monopoly over both air and space. Chinese corporations building trains and aircraft \u2013 on the largest end of the spectrum \u2013 are diluting monopolies enjoyed for decades by corporations like Boeing and Airbus.\n\nOn the smaller end of the spectrum, localized manufacturing of simpler goods carried out by individuals or small businesses, both within formal and informal economies and markets, are chipping away at centralized manufacturing and retail monopolies.\n\nAlternative energy such as solar power lends itself well to decentralized power production both for individuals and members of networks known as microgrids. As these microgrids proliferate, energy monopolies will inevitably whither.\n\nAnd the organic food movement \u2013 a mesh network that continues to expand by leaps and bound in both size and capabilities \u2013 has challenged and in some instances, entirely replaced centralized agricultural and processing monopolies who also constitute the membership of the US deep state.\n\nSolving the Deep State Problem\n\nDespite this, the deep state still poses a formidable and dangerous threat to both global and individual peace and prosperity.\n\nThe natural human inclination to create alternatives to compete with such a threat \u2013 but which simply resemble a mirrored version of the threat \u2013 means that a \u201cChinese\u201d or \u201cRussian\u201d dominated deep state leading any given unipolar global order will simply replace America\u2019s immense deep state and continue carrying on the abuses and destructive role Wall Street and Washington currently fulfill.\n\nTalk of a multipolar world order in which nations balance themselves against one another rather than fall under a single, unipolar order dominated by a single deep state and the handful of interests that constitute it, forms a bridge between today\u2019s current global order and a decentralized, balanced future.\n\nA multipolar world order in which nations are balanced globally, then leads to an internal process of decentralization and balance, all of which is driven by technology and the opportunities in business and sociopolitical pursuits opened up by it which allow each individual to take a more proportional share of a nation\u2019s or community\u2019s resources.\n\nWhile it may seem counterintiutive for nations like Russia, India, or China, or even smaller players like Iran, Thailand, or Brazil to invest in decentralization, national and local self-sufficiency, and even informal economies, currencies, and markets, by doing so, they help chip away at the current, dominate global deep state which through its media and consumerism still reaches into, threatens, and influences virtually every society on Earth.\n\nUltimately, sidestepping the crass, unsophisticated but highly provocative and alluring strategy of tension created around the Trump administration and the alleged \u201cdeep state\u201d it is supposedly fighting, is essential in identifying and confronting the real deep state that is orchestrating both sides of this charade.\n\nPlacing stock in political functionaries of the deep state to solve the deep state problem is beyond futile \u2013 it is a ruse intentionally engineered to preserve and perpetuate the deep state. By identifying the true source of the real deep state\u2019s power and influence \u2013 the wealth it derives from its corporate-financier monopolies, its control over national and international infrastructure, and its media \u2013 we can begin devising practical alternatives to dilute these monopolies and thus the power and influence they grant those who control them.\n\nIt requires a period of transition involving both state and individual efforts pursued by all who stand threatened by the deep state \u2013 and all those who are threatened by the deep state consist of anyone who resides outside the boardrooms from within which its agenda is devised and implemented.\n\nTony Cartalucci, Bangkok-based geopolitical researcher and writer, especially for the online magazine \u201cNew Eastern Outlook,\u201d where this article first appeared.\n\nCourtesy of Activist Post", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-WAA5IJov3ig/WMJJljXNouI/AAAAAAAAPdw/N-g__JZC8XYuUlshb_1PoYeDgEdcB3nvgCLcB/s640/ThinkTanks_2.jpg?resize=640%2C452&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=640", "https://i1.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/deep-state-1.jpg?fit=800%2C445", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/images/rss/orange-medium.png", "https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/-pbuDazrzeqc/WMJJYbbMLFI/AAAAAAAAPds/omg0dm0fzO0w6LgrQbUTW4FE3S7GBRd9QCLcB/s640/Trumps_Swamp.jpg?resize=640%2C452&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/-GydzuAQcrm4/WMJJ8EKYzeI/AAAAAAAAPd4/SnNPAeBzdKoWojfZE9MKnnnvMRjsb45QgCLcB/s640/China_ARJ-21.jpg?resize=640%2C426&ssl=1"], "videos": []}
