Bush presided over the passage of the <a href=\"http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/do-you-qualify-as-a-domestic-terrorist_04062011\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PATRIOT Act and a bevy of executive orders and anti-American legislation</strong></a> that places the aura of surveillance, suspicion and control over the American people themselves, and locks down the system with a federally-controlled counter-terrorism apparatus that envelopes every aspect of the nation and its system of laws and regulation.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/here-we-stand-one-step-away-from-a-dictatorship-the-groundwork-and-foundation-have-been-put-into-place_05192015\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2006 John Warner Defense Act gave a legal basis for abandoning <em>Posse Comitatus</em> </strong></a>and opening the floodgates to U.S. military troops patrolling the homeland and exerting \u201cauthority\u201d over the people \u2013 in the name of combating terrorism.</p>\n<p>Just a sample of the <a href=\"http://www.sweetliberty.org/issues/eo/femalist.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>far-reaching power</strong></a> that has been established over the past several U.S. presidents:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Executive Order #10995:</strong> Seizure of all communications media in the United States.<br />\n<strong>Executive Order #10997:</strong> Seizure of all electric power fuels and minerals, public and private.<br />\n<strong>Executive Order #10999:</strong> Seizure of all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and total control of highways, seaports and waterways.<br />\n<strong>Executive Order #11000:</strong> Seizure of all American people for work forces under federal supervision including the splitting of families if the government finds it necessary.<br />\n<strong>Executive Order #11001:</strong> Seizure of all health, education and welfare facilities, public and private.<br />\n<strong>Executive Order #11002:</strong> Empowered the postmaster general to register all men, women and children in the U.S.<br />\n<strong>Executive Order #11003:</strong> Seizure of all airports and aircraft.<br />\n<strong>Executive Order #11004:</strong> Seizure of all housing and finance authorities to establish Forced Relocation Designated areas to be abandoned as \u201cunsafe.\u201d<br />\n<strong>Executive Order #11005:</strong> Seizure of all railroads, inland waterways and storage facilities, public and private.<br />\n<strong>Executive Order #12919:</strong> Signs June 3, 1994, by President Clinton. Encompasses all the above executive orders.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dark times, and the start of a very deep-seated tide of resistance and anger in the American people. With President Obama, a curve-ball, a fresh face not expected, and thus pacifying to the American people. But with his softer personality still came grave developments for the abuse of power by the federal government and the continuity of government structure. <a href=\"http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/executive-doomsday-order-obama-authorizes-gov-to-seize-farms-food-processing-plants-energy-resources-transportation-skilled-laborers-during-national-emergency_03182012\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Countless executive orders and laws during his administration</strong></a> furthered the tyranny, and further cooked our problems with clashing parts of society. This was extremely evident in the racial and inner-city strife that became the hallmark of the Obama era.</p>\n<p>It was less discussed how Obama signed the 2012 NDAA, and along with funding for the military, authorization to treat American citizens as potential combatants here at home on American soil.</p>\n<p>It is there in writing; President Obama even issued an executive statement with the bill explaining away how even though he consented to <a href=\"http://www.infowars.com/president-obamas-ndaa-signing-statement-i-have-the-power-to-detain-americans-but-i-wont/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>create the legal power to \u201cindefinite military detention without trial of American citizens,\u201d </strong></a>that he would never, personally, authorize the use of indefinite military detention of American citizens without trial\u2026</p>\n<p>Future presidents, however, could take up that power, and it won\u2019t make any difference whether Barack Obama agrees with the rationale or not. There\u2019s no reason here to languish here over whether President Trump will abuse that power, or that a future president might. The fact of the matter is that the temptation is there; the weapon is loaded. May cooler heads prevail.</p>\n<p>But when something does play out, it will be military, FEMA, Homeland Security, local and regional police, special units, contractors, etc. who will be implementing the techniques revealed above \u2013 civil unrest will be stopped by any means necessary.</p>\n<p>The military are literally training to occupy American cities, detain American citizens, engage anyone deemed to be a combatant, and restore order to entire cities, putting the lives of potentially tens of millions of people on hold, or upending them altogether. Will a crisis emerge, such as an economic collapse? Maybe the better question is, can such a crisis be avoided?</p>\n<p>Maybe an earth shattering catastrophe has become simply too hard to dodge. If a big enough natural disaster doesn\u2019t strike, the powers that be could simply engineer a crisis \u2013 financial, environmental spill, terrorist attack, urban riots \u2013 it really doesn\u2019t matter what type of event.</p>\n<p>This is because the fatal flaws of these cities \u2013 the problems of density, and supply vulnerabilities, and of clashing tensions between groups, and of abuse of power\u00a0 \u2013 will create immediate problems with each and every major crisis, just as rush hour ruins the afternoon of big city communities right on schedule every day. Nobody specifically orchestrated the gridlock, though they theoretically could have, and yet the natural problems of congestion virtually guarantee that traffic will not move, people will have accidents, get angry, and have nowhere to go and no way to get out of the situation.</p>\n<p>The same metaphor will hold true for the next big urban disaster \u2013 any Hurricane Sandy could shutdown New York, Boston, Philadelphia, etc. if an evacuation is ordered, if a category 4 or 5 hits directly, if there is significant flooding, or property damage and loss of life is widespread, or another large scale terror attack takes place. The development of society has pushed more than 80% of the world\u2019s population into cities, in almost every part of the globe. It is especially true in the United States and the western world.</p>\n<p>The pressures are there, and they are real. They are waiting for the next crisis to unfold, and explode.</p>\n<p>When prepping for what could happen, and how you will handle it, consider the many vulnerabilities of the city nearest you with a sober and careful eye. Whatever your strategy for survival, keep one foot out yonder, if indeed you must be tied to cities and urban areas like everyone else. Everything you know and take for granted in cities could collapse at a moment\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/darkness-is-scheduled-civil-order-will-be-upended-military-plans-to-take-over-america_02162017\" target=\"_blank\">SHTFplan.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Don't forget to follow the D.C.

As the system, already broken, is pushed to its limits, there will be consequences both expected and unexpected.\n\nCities are growing, and a new, raw rule of law is growing with it. The future of urban warfare makes tight control over megacities, and paramilitary enforcement over the population inevitable \u2013 the pressures of mass migration, disaster and inner-city turmoil are taking their toll.\n\nSooner or later, this will happen. Be forewarned.\n\nThose who have been counting on nothing but government to cover their expenses have nowhere else to turn to than violence, looting and civil unrest.\n\nSo too, to those who have been reliant upon store shelves and the electric grid. The day will come when those dependencies will become a dangerous, toxic weakness. The beauty and ugliness of this far-reaching conspiracy theory is not just that some extreme scenario could play out, but that in the near future, in a world dominated by urban cities, nearly every disaster that strikes its area will result in extreme reactions \u2013 desperate hoards, martial law to restore order, persecution of dissidents, violence and death tolls trailing behind.\n\nAnd they are ready. The forces, each of the various agencies, military units, paramilitary units, special divisions, etc. have been training \u2013 exactly for this.\n\nAs John W. Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute notes:\n\nThe U.S. military plans to take over America by 2030. According to \u201cMegacities: Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity,\u201d a Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command, the U.S. military plans to use armed forces to solve future domestic political and social problems. \u201cOur current and past strategies can no longer hold. We are facing environments that the masters of war never foresaw. We are facing a threat that requires us to redefine doctrine and the force in radically new and different ways. The future army will confront a highly sophisticated urban-centric threat that will require that urban operations become the core requirement for the future land-force. The threat is clear. Our direction remains to be defined. The future is urban.\u201d\u2014 \u201cMegacities: Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity,\u201d a Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command What they\u2019re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation\u2019s security. The chilling five-minute training video, obtained by The Intercept through a FOIA request and made available online, paints an ominous picture of the future\u2014a future the military is preparing for\u2014bedeviled by \u201ccriminal networks,\u201d \u201csubstandard infrastructure,\u201d \u201creligious and ethnic tensions,\u201d \u201cimpoverishment, slums,\u201d \u201copen landfills, over-burdened sewers,\u201d a \u201cgrowing mass of unemployed,\u201d and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots.\n\nAnd the creepiest part of this training?\n\nApparently, while the American electorate have been concerned about \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d in Washington, D.C., the military have been concerned about \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d in American cities during a major crisis.\n\nAs John Whitehead keenly observes:\n\nAnd then comes the kicker. Three-and-a-half minutes into the Pentagon\u2019s dystopian vision of \u201ca world of Robert Kaplan-esque urban hellscapes \u2014 brutal and anarchic supercities filled with gangs of youth-gone-wild, a restive underclass, criminal syndicates, and bands of malicious hackers,\u201d the ominous voice of the narrator speaks of a need to \u201cdrain the swamps.\u201d Drain the swamps. [\u2026]Whereas Trump promised to drain the politically corrupt swamps of Washington DC of lobbyists and special interest groups, the U.S. military is plotting to drain the swamps of futuristic urban American cities of \u201cnoncombatants and engage the remaining adversaries in high intensity conflict within.\u201d [\u2026]They are people who don\u2019t support the government, people who live in fast-growing urban communities, people who may be less well-off economically than the government and corporate elite, people who engage in protests, people who are unemployed, people who engage in crime (in keeping with the government\u2019s fast-growing, overly broad definition of what constitutes a crime). In other words, in the eyes of the U.S. military, noncombatants are American citizens a.k.a. domestic extremists a.k.a. enemy combatants who must be identified, targeted, detained, contained and, if necessary, eliminated. Welcome to Battlefield America.\n\nFor those who are old enough and engaged enough to have followed the last several cycles of American politics, this is a a disaster that has been decades in the making.\n\nDuring the Reagan years, there was Rex 84 and other plans to control unstable populations during times of national emergency. Though the plan was highly secretive, the parts that did come out used the scenario of the need to deal with a mass wave of immigration from Mexico as the cover story, though the use of camps and detainment clearly implicated American dissidents and undesirables as well.\n\nA scenario very close to this could play out today, with the Trump Administration planning massive deportation and attempting to institute a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d while a huge wave of Americans on the other side of the fence are vehemently protesting his actions. It creates an atmosphere of tension, suspicion, and the emergency use of force, detainment, etc.\n\nPresident George W. Bush presided over the passage of the PATRIOT Act and a bevy of executive orders and anti-American legislation that places the aura of surveillance, suspicion and control over the American people themselves, and locks down the system with a federally-controlled counter-terrorism apparatus that envelopes every aspect of the nation and its system of laws and regulation.\n\nThe 2006 John Warner Defense Act gave a legal basis for abandoning Posse Comitatus and opening the floodgates to U.S. military troops patrolling the homeland and exerting \u201cauthority\u201d over the people \u2013 in the name of combating terrorism.\n\nJust a sample of the far-reaching power that has been established over the past several U.S. presidents:\n\nExecutive Order #10995: Seizure of all communications media in the United States.\n\nExecutive Order #10997: Seizure of all electric power fuels and minerals, public and private.\n\nExecutive Order #10999: Seizure of all means of transportation, including personal cars, trucks or vehicles of any kind and total control of highways, seaports and waterways.\n\nExecutive Order #11000: Seizure of all American people for work forces under federal supervision including the splitting of families if the government finds it necessary.\n\nExecutive Order #11001: Seizure of all health, education and welfare facilities, public and private.\n\nExecutive Order #11002: Empowered the postmaster general to register all men, women and children in the U.S.\n\nExecutive Order #11003: Seizure of all airports and aircraft.\n\nExecutive Order #11004: Seizure of all housing and finance authorities to establish Forced Relocation Designated areas to be abandoned as \u201cunsafe.\u201d\n\nExecutive Order #11005: Seizure of all railroads, inland waterways and storage facilities, public and private.\n\nExecutive Order #12919: Signs June 3, 1994, by President Clinton. Encompasses all the above executive orders.\n\nDark times, and the start of a very deep-seated tide of resistance and anger in the American people. With President Obama, a curve-ball, a fresh face not expected, and thus pacifying to the American people. But with his softer personality still came grave developments for the abuse of power by the federal government and the continuity of government structure. Countless executive orders and laws during his administration furthered the tyranny, and further cooked our problems with clashing parts of society. This was extremely evident in the racial and inner-city strife that became the hallmark of the Obama era.\n\nIt was less discussed how Obama signed the 2012 NDAA, and along with funding for the military, authorization to treat American citizens as potential combatants here at home on American soil.\n\nIt is there in writing; President Obama even issued an executive statement with the bill explaining away how even though he consented to create the legal power to \u201cindefinite military detention without trial of American citizens,\u201d that he would never, personally, authorize the use of indefinite military detention of American citizens without trial\u2026\n\nFuture presidents, however, could take up that power, and it won\u2019t make any difference whether Barack Obama agrees with the rationale or not. There\u2019s no reason here to languish here over whether President Trump will abuse that power, or that a future president might. The fact of the matter is that the temptation is there; the weapon is loaded. May cooler heads prevail.\n\nBut when something does play out, it will be military, FEMA, Homeland Security, local and regional police, special units, contractors, etc. who will be implementing the techniques revealed above \u2013 civil unrest will be stopped by any means necessary.\n\nThe military are literally training to occupy American cities, detain American citizens, engage anyone deemed to be a combatant, and restore order to entire cities, putting the lives of potentially tens of millions of people on hold, or upending them altogether. Will a crisis emerge, such as an economic collapse? Maybe the better question is, can such a crisis be avoided?\n\nMaybe an earth shattering catastrophe has become simply too hard to dodge. If a big enough natural disaster doesn\u2019t strike, the powers that be could simply engineer a crisis \u2013 financial, environmental spill, terrorist attack, urban riots \u2013 it really doesn\u2019t matter what type of event.\n\nThis is because the fatal flaws of these cities \u2013 the problems of density, and supply vulnerabilities, and of clashing tensions between groups, and of abuse of power \u2013 will create immediate problems with each and every major crisis, just as rush hour ruins the afternoon of big city communities right on schedule every day. Nobody specifically orchestrated the gridlock, though they theoretically could have, and yet the natural problems of congestion virtually guarantee that traffic will not move, people will have accidents, get angry, and have nowhere to go and no way to get out of the situation.\n\nThe same metaphor will hold true for the next big urban disaster \u2013 any Hurricane Sandy could shutdown New York, Boston, Philadelphia, etc. if an evacuation is ordered, if a category 4 or 5 hits directly, if there is significant flooding, or property damage and loss of life is widespread, or another large scale terror attack takes place. The development of society has pushed more than 80% of the world\u2019s population into cities, in almost every part of the globe. It is especially true in the United States and the western world.\n\nThe pressures are there, and they are real. They are waiting for the next crisis to unfold, and explode.\n\nWhen prepping for what could happen, and how you will handle it, consider the many vulnerabilities of the city nearest you with a sober and careful eye. Whatever your strategy for survival, keep one foot out yonder, if indeed you must be tied to cities and urban areas like everyone else. Everything you know and take for granted in cities could collapse at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nCourtesy of SHTFplan.com"}
