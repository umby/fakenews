It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that our schools are little more than indoctrination centers. They don\u2019t <span id=\"more-70880\"></span>really prepare our children for the world. They just teach them to be scared, dependent, and to disregard any traditional value. And God forbid one of your boys does something even remotely masculine outside of a physical education class or a football field. In most schools, <a href=\"https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/23024-discrimination-in-punishment-by-schools-against-boys-increases-education-gap\" target=\"_blank\">boys are treated far more harshly than girls</a> are for their bad behavior.</p>\n<p>And that may explain what happened to Hunter Jackson, a 4-year-old from Collinsville, Illinois who was attending preschool. During a visit with his grandpa, he picked up an empty .22 casing in a field and took it home with him. But when he took it to school to show his friends, all hell broke lose. The boy\u2019s mother explained what happened <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AndyBankerFOX2/posts/1404216766296771\" target=\"_blank\">in a Facebook post</a>, which has since gone viral:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Today, I picked up my happy little 4 yr old from preschool, at A Place to Grow, in Troy. My arrival was met with a stone faced teacher, who told me that Hunter brought a \u201cshotgun bullet\u201d to school. <span class=\"_5mfr _47e3\"><img class=\"img\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v8/f6d/1.5/16/1f628.png?resize=16%2C16&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" /><span class=\"_7oe\">\ud83d\ude28</span></span> I was horrified. My kid? Who just spent the weekend learning gun safety?</p>\n<p>Well\u2026.when I was escorted to the office for a sit down. I was handed a tiny .22 empty brass casing. Not a \u201cshotgun bullet\u201d. He found it on the ground, expelled from a 22 Rifle over the weekend, while Hunter was target practicing with his Police Officer Grandpa. He was so excited, and snuck it to school to show his friends. We had no idea about it.</p>\n<p>I was handed a piece of paper. No words, just eyebrows raised in disgust at my son, explaining that his behavior warranted a 7 school day suspension. Which I still was expected to pay tuition for, of course. And a threat that if his enthusiasm for guns continued, he\u2019d be permanently expelled\u2026</p></blockquote>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t the first time that Hunter had gotten in trouble for something like this. Apparently he\u2019s been warned before about turning toys into make-believe guns, which as we all know is pretty normal behaviour for little boys. That normal behaviour contributed to the school\u2019s decision to suspend him.</p>\n<p>Think about how absurd this whole thing is. I didn\u2019t even know that 4-year-old kids could get suspended. That seems like a punishment you give to older kids who actually have the mental capacity to plot and be malicious. It\u2019s for kids that have a much firmer grasp of right and wrong, and what the rules are.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>How can a 4-year-old kid understand that he\u2019s done something wrong in this instance? He didn\u2019t hurt anyone or threaten anyone, nor did he put anyone in danger. He did something that\u2019s completely innocent, and received a punishment that\u2019s normally reserved for kids who actually hurt and threaten their peers. What does that teach him?</p>\n<p>Nothing, according to his mother, who had this to say <a href=\"http://fox2now.com/2017/03/22/4-year-old-suspended-for-bringing-a-shell-casing-to-preschool-daycare-goes-viral-on-facebook/?sf65310542=1\" target=\"_blank\">when she was interviewed by the news</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c[Hunter] just was wandering around in a field and picked up and put it in his pocket and didn\u2019t tell his parents\u2026it\u2019s paranoia.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that\u2019s become quite an epidemic where guns are automatically assumed that they\u2019re bad\u2026and I\u2019m not sure how a 7-day suspension teaches my son anything about tolerance or anything about why he was wrong.\u00a0 It just means his school doesn\u2019t want him there because of things he enjoys,\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think what\u2019s going on here is pretty obvious. It\u2019s one thing for school staff to execute policy that they have no say in, but these teachers were so serious about what this kid did, and they were so ignorant about firearms in general. Clearly they\u2019re biased against firearm ownership, and they\u2019re passing that bias onto very young and impressionable kids.</p>\n<p>Like I said, schools aren\u2019t places of learning anymore.

Think about it: The Amendment WITH the wording &#8220;shall not be infringed&#8221; is the MOST infringed, licensed, and limited Amendment of the entire twenty seven. Furthermore,  a future generation of our posterity is likely to see the Second Amendment whittled away entirely or repealed altogether. This is inherent nature and danger of optional Enlightenment rights versus non-optional Biblical responsibilities, such as the following:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword [or today&#8217;s equivalent in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye Yah.&#8221; (Psalm 149:6-9)</p>\n<p>&#8220;But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own<br />\nhouse [including spiritual and physical protection], he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.&#8221; (1 Timothy 5:8)</p>\n<p>These are what Americans looked to as their authority prior to the the Second Amendment.</p>\n<p> For more, listen to &#8220;The Second Amendment: A Knife in a Gunfight,&#8221;<br />\ndelivered at the Springfield, Missouri Firearms and Freedom  Symposium, at <a href=\"http://www.bibleversusconstitution.com/#FeaturedMessages\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bibleversusconstitution.com/#FeaturedMessages</a>.</p>\n<p>At this same location, you will also find a radio interview Larry Pratt<br />\n(Executive Director of Gun Owners of America) conducted with me on this same subject.

Cliques and rampant bullying, quite often the victim of bullying punished more harshly for fighting back. Many times, bullies are part of a &#8220;protected&#8221;class&#8211;racial minorities, jocks, etc. Strong official disapproval of students making friends outside their grade level. &#8220;Peer pressure&#8221; used to push conformity.</p>\n<p>2. Teachers that don&#8217;t teach reading writing and arithmetic. Pushing communist principles such as rabid environmentalism, blaming humanity for conditions beyond our control as well as pushing &#8220;communitarianism&#8221; (&#8220;it takes a village&#8221;)&#8211;actually communism. This also ties in with teacher-recommended feminizing and drugging (mostly boys) to make them &#8220;less fidgety&#8221; and more compliant&#8211;all for the &#8220;benefit&#8221; of the teacher.</p>\n<p>3. Non-existent moral guidance&#8230;the communist concept of &#8220;values clarification&#8221;, allowing each student to set his own moral standard with no discussion permitted as to guidelines. A student dare not mention God or the Bible in &#8220;public school&#8221;&#8211;not permitted&#8230;discussing Islam is OK&#8230;even field trips to mosques are encouraged.</p>\n<p>4. Sex education that normalizes homosexuality and other deviant practices, actually<br />\nencouraging deviant behavior and downplaying heterosexuality and abstinence.</p>\n<p>5. Insane zero tolerance practices, punishing students for pop-tarts shaped like guns or a student having an &#8220;unauthorized aspirin&#8221; or plastic butter knife. Of course, abortions and birth control are available without parental notification.</p>\n<p>6. Lockdowns and backpack/locker searches by police utilizing &#8220;drug dogs&#8221;, getting<br />\nthe upcoming generation used to random unconstitutional searches. Quite often,<br />\nstudents &#8220;roughed up&#8221; by &#8220;school resource officers&#8221;&#8230;just because they can&#8230;Lockdowns should be reserved for prisons&#8211;not schools&#8230;</p>\n<p>Since these &#8220;socialization&#8221; practices seem to be the norm in our &#8220;public<br />\neducation&#8221; systems, parents who send their children to these dysfunctional<br />\n&#8220;indoctrination centers&#8221; are guilty of child abuse&#8230;</p>\n<p>Children who are homeschooled actually do much better in life as they are comfortable with people of all ages. True socialization takes place outside the classroom.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-24714\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-24714\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-24714\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-24714\">Blankety-Blank</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-24714\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-24714\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Ignorance is an important part of socialization. If everyone were to think intelligently, how could our society continue its descent into the oblivion toward which we are clearly headed?<br />\nThe problem isn&#8217;t merely indoctrination. Every culture requires some adherence to norms. No killing, no stealing, etc. The problem is that the indoctrination encompasses knee-jerk, idiotic, mindless self-righteousness. Some of that is actually funny. I can&#8217;t say &#8220;he&#8221; any more when I am talking about men and women. My grammar has to comply with newly-created politically correct norms whose roots may be well intended, but which nonetheless drive me nuts because the old grammar worked just fine and didn&#8217;t actually result in discrimination against women, as ultra-feminists wrongly insist. Then there are the less benign issues. Hyper vigilance against discrimination regarding particular groups, while ignoring far worse issues arising from the non-targeted groups. Guns are a fine example of this, though I could also talk about sociological groups. When there is a mass killing, it&#8217;s the guns that are the problem, not the psychotic who committed the murder. And mass killings are trivial compared to the number of murders occurring every day in this country. But those happen in urban ghettos, and nobody wants to really address the problem, so they just vaguely blame guns and ignore the casualties. In fact, guns do kill people. As do cars, trains, planes, food, pharmaceuticals, and lousy health care. What really contributed to this urban murder epidemic is Reagan deciding that we shouldn&#8217;t have mental health care for nutcases. Government is the fundamental problem. It could be the solution, but all those people who belong in insane asylums are instead in Congress and the White House.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-24706\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-24706\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-24706\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-24706\">ConservativeSenior</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-24706\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-24706\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Wrong school.

It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that our schools are little more than indoctrination centers. They don\u2019t really prepare our children for the world. They just teach them to be scared, dependent, and to disregard any traditional value. And God forbid one of your boys does something even remotely masculine outside of a physical education class or a football field. In most schools, boys are treated far more harshly than girls are for their bad behavior.\n\nAnd that may explain what happened to Hunter Jackson, a 4-year-old from Collinsville, Illinois who was attending preschool. During a visit with his grandpa, he picked up an empty .22 casing in a field and took it home with him. But when he took it to school to show his friends, all hell broke lose. The boy\u2019s mother explained what happened in a Facebook post, which has since gone viral:\n\nToday, I picked up my happy little 4 yr old from preschool, at A Place to Grow, in Troy. My arrival was met with a stone faced teacher, who told me that Hunter brought a \u201cshotgun bullet\u201d to school. \ud83d\ude28 I was horrified. My kid? Who just spent the weekend learning gun safety? Well\u2026.when I was escorted to the office for a sit down. I was handed a tiny .22 empty brass casing. Not a \u201cshotgun bullet\u201d. He found it on the ground, expelled from a 22 Rifle over the weekend, while Hunter was target practicing with his Police Officer Grandpa. He was so excited, and snuck it to school to show his friends. We had no idea about it. I was handed a piece of paper. No words, just eyebrows raised in disgust at my son, explaining that his behavior warranted a 7 school day suspension. Which I still was expected to pay tuition for, of course. And a threat that if his enthusiasm for guns continued, he\u2019d be permanently expelled\u2026\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time that Hunter had gotten in trouble for something like this. Apparently he\u2019s been warned before about turning toys into make-believe guns, which as we all know is pretty normal behaviour for little boys. That normal behaviour contributed to the school\u2019s decision to suspend him.\n\nThink about how absurd this whole thing is. I didn\u2019t even know that 4-year-old kids could get suspended. That seems like a punishment you give to older kids who actually have the mental capacity to plot and be malicious. It\u2019s for kids that have a much firmer grasp of right and wrong, and what the rules are.\n\nHow can a 4-year-old kid understand that he\u2019s done something wrong in this instance? He didn\u2019t hurt anyone or threaten anyone, nor did he put anyone in danger. He did something that\u2019s completely innocent, and received a punishment that\u2019s normally reserved for kids who actually hurt and threaten their peers. What does that teach him?\n\nNothing, according to his mother, who had this to say when she was interviewed by the news:\n\n\u201c[Hunter] just was wandering around in a field and picked up and put it in his pocket and didn\u2019t tell his parents\u2026it\u2019s paranoia. It\u2019s something that\u2019s become quite an epidemic where guns are automatically assumed that they\u2019re bad\u2026and I\u2019m not sure how a 7-day suspension teaches my son anything about tolerance or anything about why he was wrong. It just means his school doesn\u2019t want him there because of things he enjoys,\u201d\n\nI think what\u2019s going on here is pretty obvious. It\u2019s one thing for school staff to execute policy that they have no say in, but these teachers were so serious about what this kid did, and they were so ignorant about firearms in general. Clearly they\u2019re biased against firearm ownership, and they\u2019re passing that bias onto very young and impressionable kids.\n\nLike I said, schools aren\u2019t places of learning anymore. They exist to indoctrinate.\n\nCourtesy of SHTFplan.com", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=584", "http://i0.wp.com/shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/22-casing-.png?resize=500%2C332", "http://i0.wp.com/www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v8/f6d/1.5/16/1f628.png?resize=16%2C16&ssl=1", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg"], "videos": []}
