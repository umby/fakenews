They are also very expensive. Yet, there has been a serious problem when it comes to the parks employ.</p>\n<p>CNN <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/14/us/theme-park-employees-child-sex-stings/\">reported</a> on July 14, 2014 that a Walt Disney World security guard and janitor at SeaWorld&#8217;s Discovery Cove were among 18 men arrested in a sex sting dubbed &#8220;Operation April&#8217;s Fools,&#8221; Polk County, Florida.</p>\n<p>Those arrested responded to online ads from undercover detectives who posed as children or custodians of children.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Child predators are dangerous and out of control. They prowl the Internet for your children &#8212; children as young as 10 years old &#8212; to teach them how to have sex,&#8221; Judd said. &#8220;They arrive with candy and condoms and they leave in handcuffs and a one-way ride to the Polk County Jail.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The sting, which involved state and central Florida law enforcement agencies, <a href=\"http://www.polksheriff.org/NewsRoom/News%20Releases/Pages/04-05-2016PCSOUndercoverDetectivesCharge18SuspectsDuringOperationApril'sFools.aspx\">took place from March 29 to April 4.</a></p>\n<p>The investigation found that 35 Disney employees, as well as two SeaWorld and five Universal employees had been arrested since 2006 for sex crimes involving children.</p>\n<p>The parks all said at the time they have a zero tolerance policy for such behavior and require all employees to undergo extensive background checks.</p>\n<p>The arrests included Jeffrey Erich Binder, 26, of Winter Garden, Florida, who worked as a security guard at Walt Disney World. A Polk County Sheriff&#8217;s news release said he &#8220;arrived at the undercover location to have sexual intercourse with who he believed was a 14-year-old teenager.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;While chatting online and texting, Binder told the undercover detective he wanted to do &#8216;everything&#8217; sexual with the teenager. He purchased and brought condoms to the undercover location,&#8221; the news release said. He had his Disney security guard uniform in his car when he was arrested, according to the sheriff&#8217;s office.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPlzjLlD7HI?feature=oembed\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Binder was charged with attempted lewd battery, traveling to meet a minor, use of a computer to seduce a child and use of a two-way communication device to commit a felony.</p>\n<p>Disney World spokesperson Jacquee Wahler said Binder &#8220;has been placed on unpaid leave pending the outcome of the charges&#8221; and did not address a question about his prior arrest.</p>\n<p>Also arrested was 19-year-old Arthur Joseph Nelson, of Orlando, a janitor at SeaWorld Orlando&#8217;s Discovery Cove theme park.</p>\n<p>Nelson showed up at the undercover location to have sex with who he thought was a 14-year-old teenager the news release said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He sent pictures of his genitals, and he bought condoms on the way to the undercover location,&#8221; the release said. &#8220;After his arrest, Nelson told detectives he knew the teenager was 14 years old, he stopped at Wal-Mart to buy condoms, he chatted with underage teenagers but this was the first time he has &#8216;done something like this&#8217; and he was &#8216;high&#8217; and &#8216;horny&#8217; and thought it seemed like a good idea,&#8221; the release added.</p>\n<p>Nelson was charged with use of a two-way communication device to commit a felony, use of a computer to seduce a child, traveling to meet a minor, attempted lewd battery, transmission of harmful materials to a minor and possession of paraphernalia.</p>\n<p>Becca Bides, SeaWorld corporate communications director, said, &#8220;There is no greater responsibility than protecting the safety of our guests and ambassadors, and we have extensive measures in place including pre-employment criminal background checks and ongoing proactive security measures within our parks. We have zero tolerance for potential safety threats and have taken swift and appropriate action in this case.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Others arrested in the sting include a hospital technician, computer program director, car dealership manager, airline customer service manager and a former Polk County firefighter.</p>\n<p>What is of interest is the fact that these parks are adding insult to injury when it comes to aiding this sort of debauchery.

Disney characters were about hope, optimism and, above all else, making sure children were able to enjoy their innocence for as long as the outside world would permit. And Disney understood that part of its mission was to provide a buffer for as long as possible. Somewhere along the line, Disney went off course. No longer did it see itself as a defender of children\u2019s innocence. Instead, it saw itself as a conduit to social change. Walt Disney became Harvey Milk.\u201d \u2013Self-identified homosexual attorney Joseph R. Murray\n\nThere is no doubt that there is nothing like Orlando, Florida, and for some reason or another, it happens to be one of America\u2019s favorite playgrounds on earth for the recreation that it offers.\n\nWhether it is Sea World, Universal Studios or Disney, the parks are immaculately clean, appealing, and a lot of fun. They are also very expensive. Yet, there has been a serious problem when it comes to the parks employ.\n\nCNN reported on July 14, 2014 that a Walt Disney World security guard and janitor at SeaWorld\u2019s Discovery Cove were among 18 men arrested in a sex sting dubbed \u201cOperation April\u2019s Fools,\u201d Polk County, Florida.\n\nThose arrested responded to online ads from undercover detectives who posed as children or custodians of children.\n\n\u201cChild predators are dangerous and out of control. They prowl the Internet for your children \u2014 children as young as 10 years old \u2014 to teach them how to have sex,\u201d Judd said. \u201cThey arrive with candy and condoms and they leave in handcuffs and a one-way ride to the Polk County Jail.\u201d\n\nThe sting, which involved state and central Florida law enforcement agencies, took place from March 29 to April 4.\n\nThe investigation found that 35 Disney employees, as well as two SeaWorld and five Universal employees had been arrested since 2006 for sex crimes involving children.\n\nThe parks all said at the time they have a zero tolerance policy for such behavior and require all employees to undergo extensive background checks.\n\nThe arrests included Jeffrey Erich Binder, 26, of Winter Garden, Florida, who worked as a security guard at Walt Disney World. A Polk County Sheriff\u2019s news release said he \u201carrived at the undercover location to have sexual intercourse with who he believed was a 14-year-old teenager.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile chatting online and texting, Binder told the undercover detective he wanted to do \u2018everything\u2019 sexual with the teenager. He purchased and brought condoms to the undercover location,\u201d the news release said. He had his Disney security guard uniform in his car when he was arrested, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nBinder was charged with attempted lewd battery, traveling to meet a minor, use of a computer to seduce a child and use of a two-way communication device to commit a felony.\n\nDisney World spokesperson Jacquee Wahler said Binder \u201chas been placed on unpaid leave pending the outcome of the charges\u201d and did not address a question about his prior arrest.\n\nAlso arrested was 19-year-old Arthur Joseph Nelson, of Orlando, a janitor at SeaWorld Orlando\u2019s Discovery Cove theme park.\n\nNelson showed up at the undercover location to have sex with who he thought was a 14-year-old teenager the news release said.\n\n\u201cHe sent pictures of his genitals, and he bought condoms on the way to the undercover location,\u201d the release said. \u201cAfter his arrest, Nelson told detectives he knew the teenager was 14 years old, he stopped at Wal-Mart to buy condoms, he chatted with underage teenagers but this was the first time he has \u2018done something like this\u2019 and he was \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018horny\u2019 and thought it seemed like a good idea,\u201d the release added.\n\nNelson was charged with use of a two-way communication device to commit a felony, use of a computer to seduce a child, traveling to meet a minor, attempted lewd battery, transmission of harmful materials to a minor and possession of paraphernalia.\n\nBecca Bides, SeaWorld corporate communications director, said, \u201cThere is no greater responsibility than protecting the safety of our guests and ambassadors, and we have extensive measures in place including pre-employment criminal background checks and ongoing proactive security measures within our parks. We have zero tolerance for potential safety threats and have taken swift and appropriate action in this case.\u201d\n\nOthers arrested in the sting include a hospital technician, computer program director, car dealership manager, airline customer service manager and a former Polk County firefighter.\n\nWhat is of interest is the fact that these parks are adding insult to injury when it comes to aiding this sort of debauchery. On March 15, 2017, Entertainment headline read \u201cDisney won\u2019t censor Beauty and the Beast gay scenes for Malaysia.\u201d\n\nEven the homosexuals are saying that this is going too far.\n\nA Mississippi attorney who identifies as a homosexual is objecting to the \u201cgay\u201d content in Disney\u2019s live remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d saying children should not be exposed to adult topics that seek to destroy their innocence.\n\nIn an Orlando Sentinel column, Joseph R. Murray said the company is straying away from Walt Disney\u2019s original vision to \u201centertain children\u201d and is now pushing a political agenda.\n\n\u201cThe vision for Walt\u2019s world was clear: Entertain children. Disney characters were about hope, optimism and, above all else, making sure children were able to enjoy their innocence for as long as the outside world would permit. And Disney understood that part of its mission was to provide a buffer for as long as possible,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSomewhere along the line, Disney went off course,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo longer did it see itself as a defender of children\u2019s innocence. Instead, it saw itself as a conduit to social change. Walt Disney became Harvey Milk.\u201d\n\nAnd to such a statement, I warned the homosexual communities that their leaders are going to take them where they do not want to go, and they are doing so (Proverbs 26:27).\n\nMaybe they should look at their icons to understand what is happening here.\n\nFurthermore, it has not nor has it ever been about redefining marriage to include homosexuals, which has never been in the history of mankind.\n\nThe extorted politicians of the day may help you understand why things are moving in the direction they are, as well.\n\nIt has always been about the children (Luke 17:2). I have been a target of a homosexual at a young age when I was made an open prey. That is when I was part of a fatherless program called \u201cBig Brothers\u201d (Exodus 22:22-24).\n\nThis is about protecting our young people regardless of what organization they are a part.\n\nI have been faithfully blowing the trumpet (Ezekiel 33) regardless of the status quo. Why the American people sit down when it comes to the abominable (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:24; 2 Peter 2:6; etc\u2026) lifestyles that these companies are promoting, while all along playing to less than 1.7 % of the population and 78% profess to love God yet advocate through apathy what God condemns, I do not know.\n\nHow is it that anyone with a conscience can further support these organizations, all the while knowing what it is that they are attempting to advocate as the norm?\n\nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost\n\nBradlee Dean is an ordained preacher, heavy metal drummer, talk-show host of the Sons of Liberty Radio, and speaks on college and high school campuses in churches, and headlines for patriot events across the country.
