The disagreement has turned ugly and parents Christian and <span id=\"more-71225\"></span>Katie Maple say they have lost custody of their son over refusing medical treatment that they deemed excessive and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://medicalkidnap.com/2017/03/21/ohio-parents-disagree-with-school-over-adhd-diagnosis-lose-7-year-old-son-to-cps/\">report</a> from Medical Kidnap and Health Impact News, the incident originated in February when the Maples were alerted by their son Camden\u2019s school, Bowman Primary School, that a \u201cdisruption\u201d had been caused in class by Camden. Camden had allegedly remarked in class that he was feeling bad about himself and wished that he could be \u201cerased\u201d from the earth.</p>\n<p>The Maples say that the school\u2019s counselor chose to follow up on this remark by asking Camden how he would go about erasing himself, and Camden responded that he would \u201cstab himself in the eye with a knife.\u201d Christian then went to the school to retrieve Camden for a discussion at home about the incident.</p>\n<p>The Maples claim that they had a lengthy discussion following the incident. Camden said that he was feeling upset that day, but didn\u2019t wish actual harm upon himself and made the remarks to see what the counselor\u2019s reaction would be. Katie <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/help-us-get-our-son-home\">further explained</a> that \u201cThe school thought we should have taken him to the hospital emergency room for a mental health evaluation, but upon assessing the situation and speaking to him at home, it was clear to us that he posed no threat to himself and just said it to get a rise out of the counselor. He has never said anything about harming himself prior to this incident or after. This was one time, one day\u2026most likely repeating something he heard somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>While the school had reportedly urged the Maples to seek an emergency mental health evaluation of Camden, the parents felt that they had properly handled the situation and chose not to send Camden to the emergency room for an evaluation. The school reportedly pressed the matter further, asking the Maples if they had taken Camden to the hospital and inquiring about what they had discussed with Camden.</p>\n<p>The Maples said that the school contacted CPS after their conversation, and that this was not the first time the school had done so. Katie Maple provided the following context regarding how she and the school have clashed in the past over how to raise Camden:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My stepson Camden is a very energetic and intelligent 7 year old. He tested a full grade level above where he should be! Camden gets very good grades, but he gets bored easily in class and acts out on occasion, like children sometimes do. The school thinks he is ADHD, we as parents disagree. We believe that it stems mostly from boredom and not being challenged in the classroom. The school has tried on several occasions to get us to have him diagnosed, so that he can be medicated. We as parents do not have the problems the school claims to have with him, at home. We know how to deal with a rambunctious 7 year old, but the school is content with making him believe that he is a bad child, we disagree.</p>\n<p>The school did not like us going against their recommendations and proceeded to call children services 4 times over the course of the past year for false allegations ranging from physical abuse, neglect and no food in the house. We have no idea where these allegations came from, as we do not abuse our children and we have plenty of food. They were obviously completely made up. CPS never contacted us about these phone calls because they themselves admit that the calls were unsubstantiated.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div></blockquote>\n<p>Christian Maple said that he received a call from CPS after the incident at Camden\u2019s school regarding a report of neglect; he said that CPS requested a home visit to \u201cinvestigate.\u201d Christian declined to grant permission to have CPS come into their home and said he reminded the agency of his 4th Amendment rights. Christian said he then received another call from CPS, about 2 weeks after the original incident, alerting him that he had a court hearing to attend that afternoon about the incident. \u201cUpon appearing in court we find out that the allegations have now changed from neglect to a \u201cdependent child\u201d case,\u201d Katie said. \u201cWe find out that this is an \u2018Emergency shelter care\u2019 hearing later, we had no idea what we were walking into.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Maples said that at this hearing, CPS sought to remove Camden from his home by claiming that the child has a mental disorder that requires him to be placed in custody of CPS. During this hearing, the court granted CPS permission to take him out of his family\u2019s care and into custody of CPS. Katie said that this was done with \u201czero proof of any such condition and zero proof of any parental wrongdoing.\u201d</p>\n<p>A common argument heard within the public school system is that students who are victims of neglect need administrators and counselors to step in and assist in behavior-related incidents. This case appears to be a worrisome overstepping of parental authority; there is no evidence of depression or other behavioral issues in Camden provided thus far, and the Maple family appears steadfast in their dedication to handle any issue their son may face. Removal of a child from his home, which was once only conducted in extreme cases with hard evidence of mistreatment, is an action that holds drastic consequences for the entire family.</p>\n<p>A hearing in the Maple family case was scheduled on March 23rd, and an adjudication hearing is set for April 20th.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy husband and I have talked with lawyers, counselors, friends and family and everyone agrees that this does not add up and what CPS and the court has done is wrong and not typical protocol. They have no case for abuse or neglect and are now fishing for a reason to justify their actions. They have ordered my husband and I to undergo a drug and alcohol screening, random drug tests and a mental health evaluation,\u201d said Katie. \u201cWe have completed the evaluations. Our evaluator was thoroughly confused as to why we were even in her office and could not believe the situation that had brought us there. We have zero substance abuse issues. We do not do drugs and have never been accused of such. We have zero mental health issues. Why would they order us to do this?

They truly believe they have no bounds.  As far as this comment goes &#8212; &#8220;Our evaluator was thoroughly confused as to why we were even in her office and could not believe the situation that had brought us there. &#8221; &#8212; this is nothing but a Big Fat lie. This person is telling you this to your face while they are telling CPS a whole different story, unless, of course, they are not on CPS&#8217;s payroll.  I SUSPECT THAT THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THIS CHILD IS THAT HE IS SO TOTALLY BORED AT SCHOOL HE IS LOOSING HIS MIND.  Remember, schools teach to the lowest common denominator these days, not the highest and not to the middle.  Public schools are structured to not bring students up to a higher standard, but to take students down to lower standards.  Schools teach so every one receives a passing grade, regardless of ability.  Been there, done that and we have paid the ultimate price.  My recommendation is that you figure out a way to get him out of public school.  There are options.  There are expensive options.  There are no options that I know of that are inexpensive.  BUT, if you value your child, something needs to be done and that something maybe drastic, but do it.  The least expensive option may be to have a stay-at-home parent homeschool.  Praying for you!!</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-25687\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-25687\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-25687\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-25687\">clarioncaller</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-25687\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-25687\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>CPS and DYFS do not have a very good track record of keeping children safe AFTER they&#8217;ve removed them from their homes.

My Grandson was in the same situation. His teachers were adamant that he be put on ADHD drugs. He was a zombie and started having hallucinations. He gained an excessive amount of weight. He was so far behind in school that I took him to a Tutoring center. His initial testing at the center indicated he had Auditory problems. He excelled in every other test except this one. I took him to a hearing center where he was diagnosed with Auditory processing problems. I then found out that this problem along with another sensory problem mimic ADHD. I had been arguing with the school about taking him off of the drugs and you would think I was threatening to beat him. Once summer school break came along I weaned him off of the drug and sent him to therapy for the auditory problems. He went back to school and at the first school meeting they all said how great the drugs were working. The look on their faces when I told them he was off of them was PRICELESS.

The disagreement has turned ugly and parents Christian and Katie Maple say they have lost custody of their son over refusing medical treatment that they deemed excessive and unnecessary.\n\nAccording to a report from Medical Kidnap and Health Impact News, the incident originated in February when the Maples were alerted by their son Camden\u2019s school, Bowman Primary School, that a \u201cdisruption\u201d had been caused in class by Camden. Camden had allegedly remarked in class that he was feeling bad about himself and wished that he could be \u201cerased\u201d from the earth.\n\nThe Maples say that the school\u2019s counselor chose to follow up on this remark by asking Camden how he would go about erasing himself, and Camden responded that he would \u201cstab himself in the eye with a knife.\u201d Christian then went to the school to retrieve Camden for a discussion at home about the incident.\n\nThe Maples claim that they had a lengthy discussion following the incident. Camden said that he was feeling upset that day, but didn\u2019t wish actual harm upon himself and made the remarks to see what the counselor\u2019s reaction would be. Katie further explained that \u201cThe school thought we should have taken him to the hospital emergency room for a mental health evaluation, but upon assessing the situation and speaking to him at home, it was clear to us that he posed no threat to himself and just said it to get a rise out of the counselor. He has never said anything about harming himself prior to this incident or after. This was one time, one day\u2026most likely repeating something he heard somewhere.\u201d\n\nWhile the school had reportedly urged the Maples to seek an emergency mental health evaluation of Camden, the parents felt that they had properly handled the situation and chose not to send Camden to the emergency room for an evaluation. The school reportedly pressed the matter further, asking the Maples if they had taken Camden to the hospital and inquiring about what they had discussed with Camden.\n\nThe Maples said that the school contacted CPS after their conversation, and that this was not the first time the school had done so. Katie Maple provided the following context regarding how she and the school have clashed in the past over how to raise Camden:\n\nMy stepson Camden is a very energetic and intelligent 7 year old. He tested a full grade level above where he should be! Camden gets very good grades, but he gets bored easily in class and acts out on occasion, like children sometimes do. The school thinks he is ADHD, we as parents disagree. We believe that it stems mostly from boredom and not being challenged in the classroom. The school has tried on several occasions to get us to have him diagnosed, so that he can be medicated. We as parents do not have the problems the school claims to have with him, at home. We know how to deal with a rambunctious 7 year old, but the school is content with making him believe that he is a bad child, we disagree. The school did not like us going against their recommendations and proceeded to call children services 4 times over the course of the past year for false allegations ranging from physical abuse, neglect and no food in the house. We have no idea where these allegations came from, as we do not abuse our children and we have plenty of food. They were obviously completely made up. CPS never contacted us about these phone calls because they themselves admit that the calls were unsubstantiated.\n\nChristian Maple said that he received a call from CPS after the incident at Camden\u2019s school regarding a report of neglect; he said that CPS requested a home visit to \u201cinvestigate.\u201d Christian declined to grant permission to have CPS come into their home and said he reminded the agency of his 4th Amendment rights. Christian said he then received another call from CPS, about 2 weeks after the original incident, alerting him that he had a court hearing to attend that afternoon about the incident. \u201cUpon appearing in court we find out that the allegations have now changed from neglect to a \u201cdependent child\u201d case,\u201d Katie said. \u201cWe find out that this is an \u2018Emergency shelter care\u2019 hearing later, we had no idea what we were walking into.\u201d\n\nThe Maples said that at this hearing, CPS sought to remove Camden from his home by claiming that the child has a mental disorder that requires him to be placed in custody of CPS. During this hearing, the court granted CPS permission to take him out of his family\u2019s care and into custody of CPS. Katie said that this was done with \u201czero proof of any such condition and zero proof of any parental wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nA common argument heard within the public school system is that students who are victims of neglect need administrators and counselors to step in and assist in behavior-related incidents. This case appears to be a worrisome overstepping of parental authority; there is no evidence of depression or other behavioral issues in Camden provided thus far, and the Maple family appears steadfast in their dedication to handle any issue their son may face. Removal of a child from his home, which was once only conducted in extreme cases with hard evidence of mistreatment, is an action that holds drastic consequences for the entire family.\n\nA hearing in the Maple family case was scheduled on March 23rd, and an adjudication hearing is set for April 20th.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I have talked with lawyers, counselors, friends and family and everyone agrees that this does not add up and what CPS and the court has done is wrong and not typical protocol. They have no case for abuse or neglect and are now fishing for a reason to justify their actions. They have ordered my husband and I to undergo a drug and alcohol screening, random drug tests and a mental health evaluation,\u201d said Katie. \u201cWe have completed the evaluations. Our evaluator was thoroughly confused as to why we were even in her office and could not believe the situation that had brought us there. We have zero substance abuse issues. We do not do drugs and have never been accused of such. We have zero mental health issues. Why would they order us to do this? Again, another fishing attempt to try to find a reason for justifying their actions.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of The Free Thought Project", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=640", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/images/rss/orange-medium.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/famly-696x366.jpg?fit=696%2C366", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg"], "videos": []}
