Neil Nakahodo and Chris Ochsner The Kansas City Star</strong></p>\n<p>A Columbia man is accused of plotting a Presidents Day jihadist terrorist attack on buses, trains and a train station in Kansas City.</p>\n<p>Robert Lorenzo Hester Jr., 25, was charged in U.S. District Court of Kansas City with<strong> attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The charges were the culmination of a months-long FBI investigation during which Hester allegedly expressed his willingness to assist in what he believed was an Islamic State plan to cause mass casualties in an attack on U.S. soil.</strong></p>\n<p>During the investigation, undercover FBI employees posing as Islamic State operatives met with Hester on numerous occasions. At their request, he allegedly bought items that he believed were to be used in constructing bombs, including nails to cause maximum casualties.</p>\n<p><strong>He was arrested Friday after a final meeting with an undercover FBI employee he believed to be an Islamic State sympathizer, according to court documents.</strong></p>\n<p>An FBI employee told Hester that the attacks were planned for Presidents Day in Kansas City.</p>\n<p><strong>Hester allegedly predicted that Monday was \u201cgoing to be a good day for Muslims worldwide\u201d and that it felt \u201cgood to help strike back at the true terrorist.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cFirst on social media, then during face-to-face meetings with an undercover FBI employee, this defendant repeatedly expressed his intent to engage in acts of violent jihad against the United States,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri Tammy Dickinson said in a written statement. <strong>\u201cHe believed he was part of an ISIS-sponsored terrorist attack that would result in the deaths and injuries of many innocent victims</strong>,\u201d she added, using a common acronym for the Islamic State.</p>\n<p>Dickinson\u2019s office announced the charges Tuesday after Hester made an initial appearance in federal court.</p>\n<p>Officials said he was closely monitored by the FBI throughout the alleged plot. To ensure Hester didn\u2019t actually carry out an attack, an undercover FBI employee threatened Hester\u2019s family if he committed any violence outside what they were planning, according to court documents.</p>\n<p>Hester is the married father of two small children, and his wife is pregnant with a third child. His wife declined to comment when reached by The Star by phone Tuesday.</p>\n<p><strong>Prosecutors said Hester is a Missouri-born American citizen. He joined the U.S. Army in 2012 and completed basic combat training, but during advanced training he was cited for violating numerous Army regulations and received a general discharge in mid-2013.</strong></p>\n<p>An Army spokeswoman said that general discharges are typically for \u201cservice members whose service is satisfactory, but involved situations where the soldier\u2019s conduct and/or performance of duty were not so meritorious to warrant an honorable discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRecipients of general discharges usually have engaged in minor misconduct or have received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\u201d the spokeswoman said.</p>\n<p>The investigation into Hester began in August after the <strong>FBI received tips from multiple sources about social media posts in which he expressed his dislike of the United States and his adherence to radical Islamic theology,</strong> according to an affidavit filed in support of the criminal charges.</p>\n<p><strong>During the investigation, Hester allegedly said \u201cthat the U.S. government should be \u2018overthrown,\u2019 and suggested \u2018hitting\u2019 the government \u2018hard,\u2019 while noting that it would not be \u2018a one man job,\u2019 \u201d prosecutors said. Hester identified categories of potential targets for attack, such as oil production facilities and Wall Street, and said he wanted a \u201cglobal jihad.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>His<strong> social media posts included pictures of weapons and the black flag used by the Islamic State,</strong> prosecutors said.</p>\n<p>One Facebook page identified in court documents as belonging to Hester, under the alias Rami Talib, includes a photo of Hester and his two children. Hester\u2019s own Facebook page shows photos of guns, posts about the Islamic State and articles questioning official accounts of attacks on police last year in Baton Rouge, La., and Dallas. One of the last updates visible on the page, from July 19, reads: \u201cNeed a break before I start breaking necks #fedup.\u201d</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>According to the affidavit:</p>\n<p>Last October, Hester \u2014 under the alias Ali Talib Muhammad \u2014 sent a friend request to an FBI employee using an undercover identity.</p>\n<p>The employee contacted Hester by private message two days after Hester reportedly had been released from jail after a domestic disturbance in Columbia during which he was armed with a 9 mm handgun.</p>\n<p>During subsequent social media communications, the FBI employee arranged for a meeting between Hester and like-minded \u201cbrothers.\u201d</p>\n<p>During a meeting Jan. 31, the undercover employee provided Hester with a list of items to purchase, including 9-volt batteries, duct tape, copper wire and roofing nails.</p>\n<p>The undercover employee told Hester the materials were needed \u201cto make \u2026 things \u2026 to bring some kind of destruction.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hester allegedly told the employee, \u201cI\u2019m just ready to help. I\u2019m ready to help any way I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>He also allegedly said \u201cI can\u2019t wait\u201d when informed that what was being planned would \u201cbring them to their knees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hester reportedly bought the items as instructed, and the FBI employee told him they were planning something 10 times bigger than the Boston Marathon bombings in which \u201ca lot\u201d of people would be killed.</p>\n<p>When asked if he wanted out of the plot, Hester said, \u201cI\u2019m down.\u201d</p>\n<p>During that meeting, the undercover employee showed Hester three AK-47-style rifles and two .45-caliber handguns. The undercover worker said they needed more ammunition, and Hester told him he could buy some after he received his tax refund.</p>\n<p>The undercover employee also showed Hester a backpack, which contained pipes and fuse, stating, \u201cThese are bombs right here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The undercover employee explained that the duct tape Hester provided would be used to tape the bombs together, which Hester acknowledged, and that the nails Hester provided would \u201ccut peoples\u2019 heads off.\u201d Hester reportedly responded: \u201cOh yeah. I know,\u201d indicating he understood the nails were to be used as shrapnel for bombs.</p>\n<p>The undercover employee said they had more backpacks that they were going to put in different locations. Hester acknowledged that he understood, and allegedly stated that they had to be smarter than the Boston Marathon bombers. Hester again confirmed that he was \u201cdown,\u201d the affidavit says, and that he understood they had to \u201clay low\u201d and act in a manner to avoid detection.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, an undercover FBI employee messaged Hester that the \u201cparty\u201d they were planning would take place on Presidents Day in Kansas City.

Robert Lorenzo Hester, aka Ali Talib Muhammad, is said to have approved of the destruction and harm and reaffirmed his commitment to the attack.\n\nDuring the investigation, Ali Talib Muhammad said \u201cthat the U.S. government should be \u2018overthrown,\u2019 and suggested \u2018hitting\u2019 the government \u2018hard,\u2019 while noting that it would not be \u2018a one man job,\u2019 \u201d prosecutors said.

Neil Nakahodo and Chris Ochsner The Kansas City Star\n\nA Columbia man is accused of plotting a Presidents Day jihadist terrorist attack on buses, trains and a train station in Kansas City.\n\nRobert Lorenzo Hester Jr., 25, was charged in U.S. District Court of Kansas City with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nThe charges were the culmination of a months-long FBI investigation during which Hester allegedly expressed his willingness to assist in what he believed was an Islamic State plan to cause mass casualties in an attack on U.S. soil.\n\nDuring the investigation, undercover FBI employees posing as Islamic State operatives met with Hester on numerous occasions. At their request, he allegedly bought items that he believed were to be used in constructing bombs, including nails to cause maximum casualties.\n\nHe was arrested Friday after a final meeting with an undercover FBI employee he believed to be an Islamic State sympathizer, according to court documents.\n\nAn FBI employee told Hester that the attacks were planned for Presidents Day in Kansas City.\n\nHester allegedly predicted that Monday was \u201cgoing to be a good day for Muslims worldwide\u201d and that it felt \u201cgood to help strike back at the true terrorist.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst on social media, then during face-to-face meetings with an undercover FBI employee, this defendant repeatedly expressed his intent to engage in acts of violent jihad against the United States,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri Tammy Dickinson said in a written statement. \u201cHe believed he was part of an ISIS-sponsored terrorist attack that would result in the deaths and injuries of many innocent victims,\u201d she added, using a common acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nDickinson\u2019s office announced the charges Tuesday after Hester made an initial appearance in federal court.\n\nOfficials said he was closely monitored by the FBI throughout the alleged plot. To ensure Hester didn\u2019t actually carry out an attack, an undercover FBI employee threatened Hester\u2019s family if he committed any violence outside what they were planning, according to court documents.\n\nHester is the married father of two small children, and his wife is pregnant with a third child. His wife declined to comment when reached by The Star by phone Tuesday.\n\nProsecutors said Hester is a Missouri-born American citizen. He joined the U.S. Army in 2012 and completed basic combat training, but during advanced training he was cited for violating numerous Army regulations and received a general discharge in mid-2013.\n\nAn Army spokeswoman said that general discharges are typically for \u201cservice members whose service is satisfactory, but involved situations where the soldier\u2019s conduct and/or performance of duty were not so meritorious to warrant an honorable discharge.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecipients of general discharges usually have engaged in minor misconduct or have received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nThe investigation into Hester began in August after the FBI received tips from multiple sources about social media posts in which he expressed his dislike of the United States and his adherence to radical Islamic theology, according to an affidavit filed in support of the criminal charges.\n\nDuring the investigation, Hester allegedly said \u201cthat the U.S. government should be \u2018overthrown,\u2019 and suggested \u2018hitting\u2019 the government \u2018hard,\u2019 while noting that it would not be \u2018a one man job,\u2019 \u201d prosecutors said. Hester identified categories of potential targets for attack, such as oil production facilities and Wall Street, and said he wanted a \u201cglobal jihad.\u201d\n\nHis social media posts included pictures of weapons and the black flag used by the Islamic State, prosecutors said.\n\nOne Facebook page identified in court documents as belonging to Hester, under the alias Rami Talib, includes a photo of Hester and his two children. Hester\u2019s own Facebook page shows photos of guns, posts about the Islamic State and articles questioning official accounts of attacks on police last year in Baton Rouge, La., and Dallas. One of the last updates visible on the page, from July 19, reads: \u201cNeed a break before I start breaking necks #fedup.\u201d\n\nAccording to the affidavit:\n\nLast October, Hester \u2014 under the alias Ali Talib Muhammad \u2014 sent a friend request to an FBI employee using an undercover identity.\n\nThe employee contacted Hester by private message two days after Hester reportedly had been released from jail after a domestic disturbance in Columbia during which he was armed with a 9 mm handgun.\n\nDuring subsequent social media communications, the FBI employee arranged for a meeting between Hester and like-minded \u201cbrothers.\u201d\n\nDuring a meeting Jan. 31, the undercover employee provided Hester with a list of items to purchase, including 9-volt batteries, duct tape, copper wire and roofing nails.\n\nThe undercover employee told Hester the materials were needed \u201cto make \u2026 things \u2026 to bring some kind of destruction.\u201d\n\nHester allegedly told the employee, \u201cI\u2019m just ready to help. I\u2019m ready to help any way I can.\u201d\n\nHe also allegedly said \u201cI can\u2019t wait\u201d when informed that what was being planned would \u201cbring them to their knees.\u201d\n\nHester reportedly bought the items as instructed, and the FBI employee told him they were planning something 10 times bigger than the Boston Marathon bombings in which \u201ca lot\u201d of people would be killed.\n\nWhen asked if he wanted out of the plot, Hester said, \u201cI\u2019m down.\u201d\n\nDuring that meeting, the undercover employee showed Hester three AK-47-style rifles and two .45-caliber handguns. The undercover worker said they needed more ammunition, and Hester told him he could buy some after he received his tax refund.\n\nThe undercover employee also showed Hester a backpack, which contained pipes and fuse, stating, \u201cThese are bombs right here.\u201d\n\nThe undercover employee explained that the duct tape Hester provided would be used to tape the bombs together, which Hester acknowledged, and that the nails Hester provided would \u201ccut peoples\u2019 heads off.\u201d Hester reportedly responded: \u201cOh yeah. I know,\u201d indicating he understood the nails were to be used as shrapnel for bombs.\n\nThe undercover employee said they had more backpacks that they were going to put in different locations. Hester acknowledged that he understood, and allegedly stated that they had to be smarter than the Boston Marathon bombers. Hester again confirmed that he was \u201cdown,\u201d the affidavit says, and that he understood they had to \u201clay low\u201d and act in a manner to avoid detection.\n\nOn Thursday, an undercover FBI employee messaged Hester that the \u201cparty\u201d they were planning would take place on Presidents Day in Kansas City. The next day, Hester met with a second undercover employee at a storage facility they were scouting. Hester was arrested.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s court hearing, a judge ordered that Hester remain in custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for Friday.\n\nProsecutors filed notice Tuesday that they would oppose bond for Hester.\n\n\u201cThe United States submits that there is clear and convincing evidence that there are no conditions which the court could place on the defendant\u2019s release which would reasonably assure the defendant\u2019s appearance in court and the safety of the community,\u201d prosecutors stated.\n\nNo lawyer is listed for Hester in court records.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Robert-Lorenzo-Hester-Jr.jpg?resize=940%2C198", "https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=640", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/images/rss/orange-medium.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Robert-Lorenzo-Hester-Jr.jpg?fit=1023%2C683"], "videos": []}
