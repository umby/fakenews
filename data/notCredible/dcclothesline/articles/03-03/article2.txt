Traditionally, most ex-presidents have chosen to move far away from Washington, but <a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/02/13/sabotage-obama-is-commanding-an-army-of-30000-anti-trump-activists-from-his-home-2-miles-from-the-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\">Barack Obama decided to <span id=\"more-70116\"></span>purchase a home less than two miles from the White House</a>, and many of his former staff members are either working directly with him or are working for his political organization <a title=\"Organizing for Action\" href=\"https://www.ofa.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Organizing for Action</a>. And of particular concern is the fact that Valerie Jarrett has actually moved into Obama\u2019s five million dollar home, which many are referring to as Obama\u2019s \u201canti-Trump command center\u201d. For eight years the Obamas wouldn\u2019t even sneeze without consulting Valerie Jarrett first, and needless to say Jarrett has not moved in to help them pick out wallpaper and drapes. Jarrett is a hardcore political operative, and she has reportedly convinced Obama that he needs to lead the fight against Trump.</p>\n<p>And when I say \u201cfight against Trump\u201d, I don\u2019t just mean trying to block his agenda from getting through Congress.</p>\n<p>What I mean is that Barack Obama actually intends to try to remove Trump from the White House. The following comes from <a title=\"the Daily Mail\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4271412/Obama-confidante-Valerie-Jarrett-moves-Kaloroma-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">the Daily Mail</a>\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p>Barack Obama is turning his new home in the posh Kalorama section of the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 just two miles away from the White House \u2013 into the nerve center of the mounting insurgency against his successor, President Donald J. Trump.</p>\n<p><strong>Obama\u2019s goal, according to a close family friend, is to oust Trump from the presidency either by forcing his resignation or through his impeachment.</strong></p>\n<p>And Obama is being aided in his political crusade by his longtime consigliere, Valerie Jarrett, who has moved into the 8,200-square-foot, $5.3-million Kaloroma mansion with the former president and Michelle Obama, long time best friends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>From this anti-Trump nerve center, the Obamas and Valerie Jarrett will be directing <a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/02/13/sabotage-obama-is-commanding-an-army-of-30000-anti-trump-activists-from-his-home-2-miles-from-the-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\">an army of more than 30,000 activists</a> that are committed to an organization known as Organizing for Action. If you read <a title=\"my previous article\" href=\"http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/sabotage-obama-is-commanding-an-army-of-30000-anti-trump-activists-from-his-home-2-miles-from-the-white-house\" target=\"_blank\">my previous article</a> about this \u201carmy of activists\u201d, you already know that Organizing for Action grew out of the Obama presidential campaigns, and at this point it claims to have 250 chapters around the nation.</p>\n<p>But of course Barack Obama does not exactly plan to just sit on the sidelines and let others do the work. Former Attorney General <a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/03/01/former-attorney-general-eric-holder-warns-that-obama-is-ready-to-roll-will-soon-publicly-join-fight-against-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Holder</a> says that Barack Obama is rested and \u201c<a title=\"ready to roll\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/eric-holder-obama-ready-public-235508\" target=\"_blank\">ready to roll</a>\u201c\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cIt\u2019s coming. He\u2019s coming,\u201d Holder said, speaking to reporters at a briefing for the new group. \u201cAnd he\u2019s ready to roll.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout, Holder said, Obama \u201cwill be a more visible part of the effort.\u201d</p>\n<p>Holder also predicted that the usual pattern of the party in the White House losing state legislative seats in off-year elections would hold next year, but \u201cI expect we\u2019ll see that on steroids with President Trump.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ever since Trump won the election in November, Barack Obama and his team have been quietly working against him.</p>\n<p>Even while Obama was all smiles in public, members of his administration were working feverishly to spread information that would undermine the incoming president. For example, just check out what <a title=\"the New York Times\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/obama-trump-russia-election-hacking.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">the New York Times</a> has just reported\u2026</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"515\" data-total-count=\"515\"><strong>In the Obama administration\u2019s last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election \u2014 and about possible contacts between associates of President-elect <a class=\"meta-per\" title=\"More articles about Donald J.

The reason why Trump and his team are continually plagued by this stuff is because of the internal sabotage that is being conducted against them.</p>\n<p>And of course the mainstream media will just eat up any anti-Trump morsel that they can possibly get their hands on. Most in the mainstream media absolutely hate Trump, and so they are quite eager to aid in sabotaging him any way that they can. Here is another example of sabotage that occurred not too long ago\u2026</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>White House officials believe Obama administration employees attempted to sabotage President Trump</strong> by releasing an incomplete memo suggesting that Trump\u2019s travel ban focusing on seven Muslim-majority countries contradicts government intelligence.</p>\n<p>The Associated Press <a title=\"reported\" href=\"https://apnews.com/39f1f8e4ceed4a30a4570f693291c866\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> on Friday that a leaked Department of Homeland Security document indicated that filtering immigrants by citizenship would not likely prevent terrorists from entering the United States.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Almost every day it seems like something new comes out, and this kind of political warfare is not going to lead anywhere good.</p>\n<p>At this point, there is very little chance that most of the country will unite behind the new president, and Obama and his team are going to continue to try to cause strife, discord and disruption any way that they can.</p>\n<p>And any time street protests break out against Trump, Obama and his leftist allies are going to do their best to fuel the fire. Eventually this could result in the kind of widespread civil unrest that I portrayed in my apocalyptic novel \u201c<a title=\"The Beginning Of The End\" href=\"http://amzn.to/2lk9lGm\" target=\"_blank\">The Beginning Of The End</a>\u201c, but Obama and his allies don\u2019t seem to be very concerned about the long-term damage that they are doing to this country.</p>\n<p>Instead, they seem to be absolutely obsessed with doing whatever is necessary to destroy Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>A lot of people were hoping that the political nastiness would end once the campaign was over, but instead it appears set to go to a whole new level.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I don\u2019t see any way that this is going to end well\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/valerie-jarrett-has-moved-into-obamas-anti-trump-command-center-to-aid-in-the-effort-to-sabotage-the-president\" target=\"_blank\">End of the American Dream</a></em></p>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Don't forget to follow the D.C.

As I have imparted in the past, it is time to get rid of this worthless, Black, Communist, Anarchist, Marxist, Socialist, Criminal and Muslim, and his girlfriend George &#8220;NAZI&#8221; Soros, Hillary Rotten Clinton and Chuckie &#8220;BOY&#8221; Schumer, for as long as they maintain their freedom to spread their poison, the United States and planet Earth will never maintain the peace that our 45th POTUS is seeking.  This worthless Black turd of an ex-44th POTUS, is working both sides of the poitical spectrum, with Chuckie &#8220;BOY&#8221; Schumer as his go to boy on the inside, while he and his girlfriend, George &#8220;NAZI&#8221; Soros plot on the outside to destroy the U.S. economy and capitalism as we know it.  What these two turds have planned by perpetuating another &#8220;SHADOW GOVERMENT,&#8221; is seditious, and therefore, our 45th POTUS needs to fit them all for an orange jump-suit and a reservation in one of our federal prisons.  I am certain that 99% of Americans will agree with me, and remember too, how our inventors attempted to bring their inventioins to perfection by trial and error, then politics should function in the same manner, taking risks and getting rid of the undesireables, such as this worthless Black turd of an ex-44th POTUS, Hillary Rotten Clinton, Soros, and Schumer, and then observe the return to law and order, and<br />\nobserve the positive change in the attitude of the American people.  Our 45th POTUS<br />\nis a brawler, not a girlish turd that the former 44th POTUS represents, fighting his<br />\nbattles from behind.  What this Black turd needs to experience, is for someone to<br />\nkick his Black ass and his surrounding Communist/Muslim cohorts, therefore, it is<br />\ntime for a positive change that this worthless Black turd never envisioned, as it was<br />\nhis position to bring the United States to her knees in accordance with his former<br />\nprofessors, Cloward and Piven and his Communist hero, Saul Alinsky, the author of<br />\n&#8220;RULES FOR RADICALS,&#8221; the book that this Black turd and Hillary Rotten Clinton<br />\nhave been following since the became Communist/Muslim radicals.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-23098\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-23098\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-23098\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-23098\">antonio marcuso</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-23098\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-23098\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>I couldn&#8217;t have said it better, and I&#8217;m pretty good at saying things:)</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-3\" id=\"dsq-comment-23129\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-23129\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-23129\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-23129\">Dennis Habern</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-23129\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-23129\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Thank you for the positive reply.  What I have imparted today, and each time that I issue a blog, is the truth, as far as I am aware, and as it has been quoted, the truth will eventually win.  What I have imparted above, needs to be read by 99% of Americans, and I have only mentioned the tip of  the ice-berg.  This BS concernnig Jeff Sessions, is nothing in comparison to how this worthless Black turd of a half-baked Mulatto mutt from Kenya, pulled the crime of the century,<br />\nbecause nobody vetted his Black worthless ass, and it appears that<br />\nNancy Pelosi is responsible for this debacle, similar to Jimmy Carter<br />\nis responsible for the current Middle East caper.  There are doubts that his White, American mother, is not his biological relation.  Until this worthless Black mutt can pony-up with his original Birth Certificate, he is to be considered an effn alien, therefore, is it any wonder that he favors his Muslim brethren and anyone else whom maintains the potential to vote for the Democratic Party.  Of course these Democrats care nothing for these foreign turds, with the exception that 99% of these turds represent a vote.  In addition, our 45th POTUS<br />\nwas correct in mandating that members from these 7 countries, not be<br />\npermitted to enter the United States, ever.  Both the Blacks and the<br />\nMuslims are cut from the same cloth, and 99% of them, are born, one<br />\ntaco short of a full-platter.  Therefore, Islam is not to be trusted, ever.<br />\nIslam is not to be contained.  Islam is required to be eliminated,<br />\nfinally, after a 1400 human rampage.  So let it be imparted, so let it<br />\nbe written, and so let it be enforced, yesterday.  And now you know<br />\nthe rest of the story.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-4\" id=\"dsq-comment-23140\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-23140\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-23140\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-23140\">apikorus</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-23140\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-23140\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Hey  Dennis,   I   have  been  reading your  stuff   a year  or  two.<br />\ncouple of  things?   did you  not  predict  that  the turd  would not  complete  his  second  term?

That has never been clarified, me thinks.  Cruz, Jindal from Lousiana, and the mutt from Florida, were never eleigible to become POTUS in the first place, and therefore Jindal made his break, early, from the race.  Other than that, I hope our 45th commences to nail these effn Communists, Anarchists, Marxists, Socialists, Criminals and Muslims, to the effn wall, showing no quarter for the felonies and the murders they are responsible, and that would include this worthless, Black turd of an ex-44th Muslim POTUS and his girlfriend, George &#8220;NAZI&#8221; Soros, Hillary Rotten Clinton, Valerie Jarrett and Chucking &#8220;BOY&#8221; Schumer.

But little does this worthless Black turd<br />\nrealize, that he is in over his head when he attempts to match wits with our 45th POTUS. In my opinion, and many other Americans, the actions of this worthless Black turd should be considered seditious, me thinks, and the acquistion of his old partner in crime, Valerie &#8220;IRAN&#8221; Jarrett to hold his hand and make his decisions for him, because he is Black, uneducated, and a ruthless scoundrel whose brain has been fried as a youth, smoking pot and injecting the hard stuff, and the LIV&#8217;s in America, elected/selected this Black turd as their hero, not once, but twice.  His elections have thoroughly indicated the poor educational mentality of the American people.  It has been proven that the 99% of the American people, only read and comprehend at the 8th grade level, and therefore, George &#8220;NAZI&#8221; Soros and his girlfriend, the worthless, ex-44th POS honed in on their incapabilities to perform the crime of the century.  Until this worthless Black turd can prove whom he really is, then our Department of Justice must consider him an effn alien, and now, it is up to our 45th POTUS, to take action against him for not only maintaining a status as an alien, but for all the felonies that he has committed against the U.S. and the American people.  The Black Community, since 1865, when the acquired their freedom from slavery, have always maintained a poor reputation, and from having lived and worked with the Black Community, it is easily to maintain that 99% of Blacks are inherently lazy, liars, poorly educated similar to their Muslim brothers, and undependable, among other things that the list is too lengthy to impart here.  In addition, instead of being awarded a lucrative book con-<br />\ntract, he and his worthless ugly so-called wife, need to be both fitted for an orange<br />\njumpsuit, destination, a Federal Prison.  Is anyone aware of why these two turds had<br />\ntheir lawyer licenses revoked?  If anyone needs for the Democrats to investigate, it&#8217;s<br />\nthis former, worthless 44th POS, not Jeff Sessions.  Has the Russians attacked the<br />\nUnited States?  No!!  Has the former 44th POS and his girlfriend George &#8220;NAZI&#8221;<br />\nSoros, attacked the United States?  Of course, for 8 effn years of his dictatorship.<br />\nRemove Soros and this Black turd from society, and then view how planet Earth<br />\nreturns to rotating on its axis, normally.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n            </ul>\n\n\n        </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar disqus_url = 'http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/03/03/valerie-jarrett-has-moved-into-obamas-anti-trump-command-center-to-aid-in-the-effort-to-sabotage-the-president/';\nvar disqus_identifier = '70116 http://www.dcclothesline.com/?p=70116';\nvar disqus_container_id = 'disqus_thread';\nvar disqus_shortname = 'dcclothesline';\nvar disqus_title = \"Valerie Jarrett Has Moved Into Obama\u2019s Anti-Trump Command Center To Aid In The Effort To Sabotage The President\";\nvar disqus_config_custom = window.disqus_config;\nvar disqus_config = function () {\n    /*\n    All currently supported events:\n    onReady: fires when everything is ready,\n    onNewComment: fires when a new comment is posted,\n    onIdentify: fires when user is authenticated\n    */\n    \n    \n    this.language = '';\n        this.callbacks.onReady.push(function () {\n\n        // sync comments in the background so we don't block the page\n        var script = document.createElement('script');\n        script.async = true;\n        script.src = '?cf_action=sync_comments&post_id=70116';\n\n        var firstScript = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n        firstScript.parentNode.insertBefore(script, firstScript);\n    });\n    \n    if (disqus_config_custom) {\n        disqus_config_custom.call(this);\n    }\n};\n\n(function() {\n    var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript';\n    dsq.async = true;\n    dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);\n})();\n</script>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</div><!-- #content -->\n\t\t</div><!-- #container -->\n\n\n\t\t<div id=\"primary\" class=\"widget-area\" role=\"complementary\">\n\t\t\t<ul class=\"xoxo\">\n\n<li id=\"blog_subscription-3\" class=\"widget-container jetpack_subscription_widget\"><h3 class=\"widget-title\">Subscribe TODAY and Never Miss Another D.C.

Traditionally, most ex-presidents have chosen to move far away from Washington, but Barack Obama decided to purchase a home less than two miles from the White House, and many of his former staff members are either working directly with him or are working for his political organization Organizing for Action. And of particular concern is the fact that Valerie Jarrett has actually moved into Obama\u2019s five million dollar home, which many are referring to as Obama\u2019s \u201canti-Trump command center\u201d. For eight years the Obamas wouldn\u2019t even sneeze without consulting Valerie Jarrett first, and needless to say Jarrett has not moved in to help them pick out wallpaper and drapes. Jarrett is a hardcore political operative, and she has reportedly convinced Obama that he needs to lead the fight against Trump.\n\nAnd when I say \u201cfight against Trump\u201d, I don\u2019t just mean trying to block his agenda from getting through Congress.\n\nWhat I mean is that Barack Obama actually intends to try to remove Trump from the White House. The following comes from the Daily Mail\u2026\n\nBarack Obama is turning his new home in the posh Kalorama section of the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 just two miles away from the White House \u2013 into the nerve center of the mounting insurgency against his successor, President Donald J. Trump. Obama\u2019s goal, according to a close family friend, is to oust Trump from the presidency either by forcing his resignation or through his impeachment. And Obama is being aided in his political crusade by his longtime consigliere, Valerie Jarrett, who has moved into the 8,200-square-foot, $5.3-million Kaloroma mansion with the former president and Michelle Obama, long time best friends.\n\nFrom this anti-Trump nerve center, the Obamas and Valerie Jarrett will be directing an army of more than 30,000 activists that are committed to an organization known as Organizing for Action. If you read my previous article about this \u201carmy of activists\u201d, you already know that Organizing for Action grew out of the Obama presidential campaigns, and at this point it claims to have 250 chapters around the nation.\n\nBut of course Barack Obama does not exactly plan to just sit on the sidelines and let others do the work. Former Attorney General Eric Holder says that Barack Obama is rested and \u201cready to roll\u201c\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming. He\u2019s coming,\u201d Holder said, speaking to reporters at a briefing for the new group. \u201cAnd he\u2019s ready to roll.\u201d Throughout, Holder said, Obama \u201cwill be a more visible part of the effort.\u201d Holder also predicted that the usual pattern of the party in the White House losing state legislative seats in off-year elections would hold next year, but \u201cI expect we\u2019ll see that on steroids with President Trump.\u201d\n\nEver since Trump won the election in November, Barack Obama and his team have been quietly working against him.\n\nEven while Obama was all smiles in public, members of his administration were working feverishly to spread information that would undermine the incoming president. For example, just check out what the New York Times has just reported\u2026\n\nIn the Obama administration\u2019s last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election \u2014 and about possible contacts between associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump and Russians \u2014 across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn\u2019t duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators. American allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials \u2014 and others close to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 and associates of President-elect Trump, according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence.\n\nIf you have ever wondered where all of these \u201cleaks\u201d are coming from, the truth is that they are coming from people inside the government that are still loyal to Obama.\n\nThursday, the Washington Post ran a story with this alarming headline: \u201cThe Trump presidency can\u2019t seem to escape Russia\u2019s shadow\u201c. The reason why Trump and his team are continually plagued by this stuff is because of the internal sabotage that is being conducted against them.\n\nAnd of course the mainstream media will just eat up any anti-Trump morsel that they can possibly get their hands on. Most in the mainstream media absolutely hate Trump, and so they are quite eager to aid in sabotaging him any way that they can. Here is another example of sabotage that occurred not too long ago\u2026\n\nWhite House officials believe Obama administration employees attempted to sabotage President Trump by releasing an incomplete memo suggesting that Trump\u2019s travel ban focusing on seven Muslim-majority countries contradicts government intelligence. The Associated Press reported on Friday that a leaked Department of Homeland Security document indicated that filtering immigrants by citizenship would not likely prevent terrorists from entering the United States.\n\nAlmost every day it seems like something new comes out, and this kind of political warfare is not going to lead anywhere good.\n\nAt this point, there is very little chance that most of the country will unite behind the new president, and Obama and his team are going to continue to try to cause strife, discord and disruption any way that they can.\n\nAnd any time street protests break out against Trump, Obama and his leftist allies are going to do their best to fuel the fire. Eventually this could result in the kind of widespread civil unrest that I portrayed in my apocalyptic novel \u201cThe Beginning Of The End\u201c, but Obama and his allies don\u2019t seem to be very concerned about the long-term damage that they are doing to this country.\n\nInstead, they seem to be absolutely obsessed with doing whatever is necessary to destroy Donald Trump.\n\nA lot of people were hoping that the political nastiness would end once the campaign was over, but instead it appears set to go to a whole new level.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u2019t see any way that this is going to end well\u2026\n\nCourtesy of End of the American Dream", "images": ["http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Barack-Obama-And-Valerie-Jarrett-Public-Domain-460x392.jpg?resize=460%2C392", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Barack-Obama-And-Valerie-Jarrett-Public-Domain-460x392.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=640", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/images/rss/orange-medium.png"], "videos": []}
