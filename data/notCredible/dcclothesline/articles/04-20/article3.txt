Although there was no investigation, and many high-profile individuals have called it a sham, the US has pinned the blame on Syrian president Bashar Al Assad. So, we thought it would be a good idea to remind our fellow Americans of an occasion where the federal government got away with <span id=\"more-71762\"></span>gassing its own people, an action which, consequently, led to the deaths of 86 men, women, and children. It all came to a violent end 24 years ago yesterday, in Texas.</p>\n<p>Our source material comes from the FBI\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/@@search?SearchableText=Koresh+&amp;pageSize=20&amp;page=1&amp;searchSite=vault.fbi.gov\" target=\"_blank\">vault</a>, which contains two files on the case against Vernon Howell, also known as David Koresh. Koresh was the leader of the \u201cBranch Davidians Seventh Day Adventists.\u201d According to the FBI case file, Koresh was believed to have been holding people against their will at his compound in Waco, Texas, potentially guilty of \u201cinvoluntary servitude and slavery\u201d charges.</p>\n<p>In 1992, Child Protective Services (CPS) was called in to investigate the accusations. After a thorough investigation, CPS concluded no one was being held at the compound against their will, nor any child abuse, and the federal prosecutor, who reviewed the report, saw no reason to prosecute Koresh. On October 16th, 1992, the FBI closed the case against Koresh and the allegations he was abusing children and holding his followers against their will.</p>\n<p>Still, however, the FBI proceeded with investigating other allegations the Branch Davidians had converted semi-automatic AR-15 (assault) rifles into fully automatic ones, a violation of federal law. Also alleged was that the group was planning a mass suicide. The FBI concluded, \u201cno information has been developed to verify the accuracy of the allegations.\u201d Still, the FBI put local law enforcement on notice.</p>\n<p>Despite having no concrete evidence Koresh, who some have said was delusional, had violated anyone\u2019s civil rights, or abused any children, the investigation into the weapons violations continued. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives pursued the allegations the group was stockpiling weapons and explosives. According to the <a href=\"https://www.atf.gov/our-history/fallen-agents/todd-w-mckeehan\" target=\"_blank\">ATF</a>, the bureau found:</p>\n<blockquote><p>136 FIREARMS, INCLUDING ASSAULT RIFLES AND HANDGUNS</p>\n<p>700+ MAGAZINES FOR THOSE FIREARMS</p>\n<p>200,000+ ROUNDS OF VARIOUS AMMUNITION</p>\n<p>110 UPPER AND LOWER RECEIVERS FOR AR15/M16 RIFLES</p>\n<p>GRENADE-LAUNCHER ATTACHMENTS FOR AR15/M16 RIFLES</p>\n<p>400+ EMPTY M31 RIFLE GRENADES, ALONG WITH BLACK POWDER AND OTHER</p>\n<p>EXPLOSIVE CHEMICALS</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wishing to further investigate the compound\u2019s armory, the ATF secured a search warrant and attempted to raid the compound on February 28th, 1993. The Davidians, possibly feeling they must protect their home, property, and persons from the intruders, opened fire on the federal agents, an action which led to the deaths of several ATF agents and compound members.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<blockquote><p>FOUR ATF AGENTS (SA TODD MCKEEHAN, SA CONWAY LEBLEU, SA ROBERT WILLIAMS AND SA STEVEN WILLIS) WERE KILLED; 20 ATF AGENTS WOUNDED FROM GUNSHOTS OR SHRAPNEL AND 8 SUFFERED OTHER INJURIES. SIX DAVIDIANS WERE ALSO REPORTEDLY KILLED AND FOUR WOUNDED FROM GUNSHOTS, ALTHOUGH THIS COULD NOT BE FORENSICALLY PROVEN BECAUSE OF THE LATER DESTRUCTION (BY FIRE) OF THE COMPOUND.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The raid initiated a 51-day standoff with the ATF as well as the FBI. Koresh released 24 members from the compound, who were mostly children, and continued the stand-off with authorities which was broadcast daily across the country until day 51 arrived. On that day, the government brought in heavy equipment and penetrated the compound with a tank-like machine which pumped the compound full of CS Gas. What happened next, in the minds of many who saw it, can only be likened to a horror film.</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:1em;\"><a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/04/18/mit-expert-fmr-dod-science-advisor-release-damning-report-syrian-gas-attack-was-staged/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"u37eb2525f5856dde484f716a6072de9d\"><!-- INLINE RELATED POSTS 1/2 //--><style> .u37eb2525f5856dde484f716a6072de9d { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:inherit; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid inherit!important; text-decoration:none; } .u37eb2525f5856dde484f716a6072de9d:active, .u37eb2525f5856dde484f716a6072de9d:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .u37eb2525f5856dde484f716a6072de9d { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .u37eb2525f5856dde484f716a6072de9d .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .u37eb2525f5856dde484f716a6072de9d .postTitle { color:inherit; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .u37eb2525f5856dde484f716a6072de9d:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } </style><div style=\"padding-left:1em; padding-right:1em;\"><span class=\"ctaText\">READ MORE</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"postTitle\">MIT Expert, Fmr DoD Science Advisor Release Damning Report: \u201cSyrian Gas Attack Was Staged\u201d</span></div></a></div><p>The compound became ablaze with a roaring fire. The all-consuming inferno killed 76 people who were huddled inside. Later, it was determined many of those who\u2019d perished were also shot by firearms. <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U3b9nvIw-_k&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Researchers</a>, who later investigated the incident, concluded federal agents were observed shooting from the compound\u2019s grounds into the building already set ablaze by fire. While the official government narrative is those individuals committed suicide, the researchers were able to demonstrate they were likely killed by automatic weapons fired by federal agents, possibly killed as they were attempting to flee their burning compound.</p>\n<p>To this day, the ATF maintains the fire was, \u201cset by cult members, as law enforcement attempted to force them out by introducing tear gas into the building.\u201d And for years, following the fiery destruction of the compound, the FBI maintained the same story line. That was until 1999, when then-Attorney<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/1999/avail82699.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> General Janet Reno</a> made the following admission, \u201cI am very, very troubled by the information I received this week suggesting that pyrotechnic devices may have been used in the early morning hours on April the 19th, 1993, at Waco. At this time, all available indications are that the devices were not directed at the main wooden compound, were discharged several hours before the fire started, and were not the cause of the fire. Nonetheless, it is absolutely critical that we do everything humanly possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible and make them available to the public and Congress.\u201d</p>\n<p>Those facts, according to some of the survivors of the fire, who were inside at the time the fire broke out, are undeniable. They are convinced the government used <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/US/9908/24/fbi.waco/\" target=\"_blank\">incendiary devices</a> to set ablaze the tear gas which had been pumped into the building. And they\u2019re not alone. According to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-really-happened-at-waco/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS News</a>, \u201cIndependent filmmaker Michael McNulty came upon some evidence that appeared damaging to the government. <strong>He found a shell casing from a certain type of tear gas round that could start a fire \u2013 a device the Justice Department had denied using for more than six years \u2013 publicly and to Congress.\u201d</strong> That shell casing led to Reno\u2019s acknowledgment, but the government still has not taken full responsibility, as Reno denied the devices were used to penetrate the building. Questions still remain as to why they would be used at all.</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:1em;\"><a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/04/19/watch-what-happens-to-american-flag-when-dnc-chair-mentions-hillary/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"u6625cc71fbb196ba297820cfb1f8a79f\"><!-- INLINE RELATED POSTS 2/2 //--><style> .u6625cc71fbb196ba297820cfb1f8a79f { padding:0px; margin: 0; padding-top:1em!important; padding-bottom:1em!important; width:100%; display: block; font-weight:bold; background-color:inherit; border:0!important; border-left:4px solid inherit!important; text-decoration:none; } .u6625cc71fbb196ba297820cfb1f8a79f:active, .u6625cc71fbb196ba297820cfb1f8a79f:hover { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; text-decoration:none; } .u6625cc71fbb196ba297820cfb1f8a79f { transition: background-color 250ms; webkit-transition: background-color 250ms; opacity: 1; transition: opacity 250ms; webkit-transition: opacity 250ms; } .u6625cc71fbb196ba297820cfb1f8a79f .ctaText { font-weight:bold; color:inherit; text-decoration:none; font-size: 16px; } .u6625cc71fbb196ba297820cfb1f8a79f .postTitle { color:inherit; text-decoration: underline!important; font-size: 16px; } .u6625cc71fbb196ba297820cfb1f8a79f:hover .postTitle { text-decoration: underline!important; } </style><div style=\"padding-left:1em; padding-right:1em;\"><span class=\"ctaText\">READ MORE</span>&nbsp; <span class=\"postTitle\">Watch What Happens to American Flag When DNC Chair Mentions Hillary</span></div></a></div><p>Even though it was later determined Koresh had, indeed, molested children, and was by all intents and purposes a pedophile of the worst kind, the fact remains.<strong> The government used gas on its own people which either directly or indirectly led to the deaths of 76 people</strong>. There was no international outcry. Foreign governments did not threaten to retaliate against the ATF and the FBI. Russia did not feel compelled to launch guided missiles into the Waco, TX airport. And neither should the United States.</p>\n<p>The U.S. has no business in the affairs of Syrians. And just like in Waco, it may take years to know precisely who was responsible for gassing and killing 83 Syrians in the Idlib Province. But go ahead and believe the official government narrative if you\u2019d like. Here at TFTP, we prefer to deal with the facts.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3b9nvIw-_k?feature=oembed\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://thefreethoughtproject.com/federal-government-gasses-nearly-80-americans-impunity/\" target=\"_blank\">The Free Thought Project</a></em></p>\n<p><em>Jack Burns is an educator, journalist, investigative reporter, and advocate of natural medicine.</em></p>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Don't forget to follow the D.C.

Although there was no investigation, and many high-profile individuals have called it a sham, the US has pinned the blame on Syrian president Bashar Al Assad. So, we thought it would be a good idea to remind our fellow Americans of an occasion where the federal government got away with gassing its own people, an action which, consequently, led to the deaths of 86 men, women, and children. It all came to a violent end 24 years ago yesterday, in Texas.\n\nOur source material comes from the FBI\u2019s own vault, which contains two files on the case against Vernon Howell, also known as David Koresh. Koresh was the leader of the \u201cBranch Davidians Seventh Day Adventists.\u201d According to the FBI case file, Koresh was believed to have been holding people against their will at his compound in Waco, Texas, potentially guilty of \u201cinvoluntary servitude and slavery\u201d charges.\n\nIn 1992, Child Protective Services (CPS) was called in to investigate the accusations. After a thorough investigation, CPS concluded no one was being held at the compound against their will, nor any child abuse, and the federal prosecutor, who reviewed the report, saw no reason to prosecute Koresh. On October 16th, 1992, the FBI closed the case against Koresh and the allegations he was abusing children and holding his followers against their will.\n\nStill, however, the FBI proceeded with investigating other allegations the Branch Davidians had converted semi-automatic AR-15 (assault) rifles into fully automatic ones, a violation of federal law. Also alleged was that the group was planning a mass suicide. The FBI concluded, \u201cno information has been developed to verify the accuracy of the allegations.\u201d Still, the FBI put local law enforcement on notice.\n\nDespite having no concrete evidence Koresh, who some have said was delusional, had violated anyone\u2019s civil rights, or abused any children, the investigation into the weapons violations continued. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives pursued the allegations the group was stockpiling weapons and explosives. According to the ATF, the bureau found:\n\n136 FIREARMS, INCLUDING ASSAULT RIFLES AND HANDGUNS 700+ MAGAZINES FOR THOSE FIREARMS 200,000+ ROUNDS OF VARIOUS AMMUNITION 110 UPPER AND LOWER RECEIVERS FOR AR15/M16 RIFLES GRENADE-LAUNCHER ATTACHMENTS FOR AR15/M16 RIFLES 400+ EMPTY M31 RIFLE GRENADES, ALONG WITH BLACK POWDER AND OTHER EXPLOSIVE CHEMICALS\n\nWishing to further investigate the compound\u2019s armory, the ATF secured a search warrant and attempted to raid the compound on February 28th, 1993. The Davidians, possibly feeling they must protect their home, property, and persons from the intruders, opened fire on the federal agents, an action which led to the deaths of several ATF agents and compound members.\n\nFOUR ATF AGENTS (SA TODD MCKEEHAN, SA CONWAY LEBLEU, SA ROBERT WILLIAMS AND SA STEVEN WILLIS) WERE KILLED; 20 ATF AGENTS WOUNDED FROM GUNSHOTS OR SHRAPNEL AND 8 SUFFERED OTHER INJURIES. SIX DAVIDIANS WERE ALSO REPORTEDLY KILLED AND FOUR WOUNDED FROM GUNSHOTS, ALTHOUGH THIS COULD NOT BE FORENSICALLY PROVEN BECAUSE OF THE LATER DESTRUCTION (BY FIRE) OF THE COMPOUND.\n\nThe raid initiated a 51-day standoff with the ATF as well as the FBI. Koresh released 24 members from the compound, who were mostly children, and continued the stand-off with authorities which was broadcast daily across the country until day 51 arrived. On that day, the government brought in heavy equipment and penetrated the compound with a tank-like machine which pumped the compound full of CS Gas. What happened next, in the minds of many who saw it, can only be likened to a horror film.\n\nThe compound became ablaze with a roaring fire. The all-consuming inferno killed 76 people who were huddled inside. Later, it was determined many of those who\u2019d perished were also shot by firearms. Researchers, who later investigated the incident, concluded federal agents were observed shooting from the compound\u2019s grounds into the building already set ablaze by fire. While the official government narrative is those individuals committed suicide, the researchers were able to demonstrate they were likely killed by automatic weapons fired by federal agents, possibly killed as they were attempting to flee their burning compound.\n\nTo this day, the ATF maintains the fire was, \u201cset by cult members, as law enforcement attempted to force them out by introducing tear gas into the building.\u201d And for years, following the fiery destruction of the compound, the FBI maintained the same story line. That was until 1999, when then-Attorney General Janet Reno made the following admission, \u201cI am very, very troubled by the information I received this week suggesting that pyrotechnic devices may have been used in the early morning hours on April the 19th, 1993, at Waco. At this time, all available indications are that the devices were not directed at the main wooden compound, were discharged several hours before the fire started, and were not the cause of the fire. Nonetheless, it is absolutely critical that we do everything humanly possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible and make them available to the public and Congress.\u201d\n\nThose facts, according to some of the survivors of the fire, who were inside at the time the fire broke out, are undeniable. They are convinced the government used incendiary devices to set ablaze the tear gas which had been pumped into the building. And they\u2019re not alone. According to CBS News, \u201cIndependent filmmaker Michael McNulty came upon some evidence that appeared damaging to the government. He found a shell casing from a certain type of tear gas round that could start a fire \u2013 a device the Justice Department had denied using for more than six years \u2013 publicly and to Congress.\u201d That shell casing led to Reno\u2019s acknowledgment, but the government still has not taken full responsibility, as Reno denied the devices were used to penetrate the building. Questions still remain as to why they would be used at all.\n\nEven though it was later determined Koresh had, indeed, molested children, and was by all intents and purposes a pedophile of the worst kind, the fact remains. The government used gas on its own people which either directly or indirectly led to the deaths of 76 people. There was no international outcry. Foreign governments did not threaten to retaliate against the ATF and the FBI. Russia did not feel compelled to launch guided missiles into the Waco, TX airport. And neither should the United States.\n\nThe U.S. has no business in the affairs of Syrians. And just like in Waco, it may take years to know precisely who was responsible for gassing and killing 83 Syrians in the Idlib Province. But go ahead and believe the official government narrative if you\u2019d like. Here at TFTP, we prefer to deal with the facts.\n\nCourtesy of The Free Thought Project\n\nJack Burns is an educator, journalist, investigative reporter, and advocate of natural medicine.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=584", "https://i1.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/NO-THIS-IS-NOT-IRAQ-696x366.jpg?fit=696%2C366", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg"], "videos": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3b9nvIw-_k?feature=oembed"]}
