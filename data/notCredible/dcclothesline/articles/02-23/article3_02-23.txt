nation is the amount of money that has been \u201csequestered,\u201d to term it, for \u201cNon-Profit Organizations,\u201d or \u201cNPO\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 They present a problem when they can be used by an unscrupulous individual or groups of <span id=\"more-69868\"></span>unscrupulous individuals (for examples, a George Soros, or the Democratic Party respectively).\u00a0 What is an NPO?\u00a0 Let\u2019s look at what they are and see if the definition is characterized by actual NPO actions.</p>\n<p>Here is an excerpt from a book that describes NPO\u2019s (what they should be):</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>\u201cThe main financial difference between a for-profit and a not-for-profit enterprise is what happens to the profit.\u00a0 In a for-profit company like Ford or Microsoft or Disney or your favorite fast-food establishment, profits are paid to the owners, including shareholders.\u00a0 But a nonprofit can\u2019t do that.\u00a0 Any profit remaining after the bills are paid has to be plowed back into the organization\u2019s service program. \u00a0So profit can\u2019t be distributed to individuals, such as the organization\u2019s board of directors, who are volunteers in every sense of the word.\u201d</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201c<u>Nonprofit Kit for Dummies</u>,\u201d ISBN: 0-7645-5347-X, pg. 8</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Austere and stoic, these NPO\u2019s, all!\u00a0 Ahh, but what is conveniently left out is the <u>salary portion</u>\u2026for the directors.\u00a0 Those salaries are written off as an operating expense by the \u201cNon-Profit,\u201d but they\u2019re hardly the funds gleaned by a \u201csimple volunteer for the beneficent NPO.\u201d\u00a0 Another paragraph from the book shows this:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>\u2026for the most part, we\u2019re talking about an organization that the Internal Revenue Service has classified as a 501(c)(3).\u00a0 They receive exemption from federal income taxes and sometimes relief from property taxes at the local level.\u00a0 Nonprofit organizations classified as 501(c)(3) receive extra privileges under the law.\u00a0 They are, with minor exceptions, the only group of tax-exempt organizations that can receive tax-deductible contributions from individuals and organizations.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Being a nonprofit organization does not mean that an entity is exempt from paying all taxes.\u00a0 Nonprofit organizations pay employment taxes just like for-profit businesses do.\u00a0 In some states, but not all, nonprofits are exempt from paying sales tax\u2026\u201d</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Ibid., p. 9</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>So, we have some of the basic parameters here for NPO\u2019s.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to delve into the different types, such as politically-organized, or the religious-type of NPO\u2019s.\u00a0 I draw the reader\u2019s attention to the simple fact that (as mentioned in the last paragraph) the NPO\u2019s <strong>\u201cpay employment taxes just like for-profit businesses do.\u201d\u00a0 </strong>How wonderfully utopian and egalitarian that sounds, all under the \u201ccolor of law!\u201d The reality is <u>far</u> from it.\u00a0 Directors of NPO\u2019s make six-figure salaries, and all their \u201cbennies\u201d (that\u2019s <em>benefits</em>, not Benzedrine\u2026well, we hope!) are little perks they take and write off as the almighty \u201coperating expense.\u201d</p>\n<p>They can\u2019t very well wear down <em>their</em> cars driving back and forth to the NPO-location, or conducting NPO business, can they?\u00a0 What they <em>do</em> have, as attested by the \u201cpay employment taxes\u201d phrase is a willing army of misfortunates they pay little more than enough to obtain dog food and perhaps live out of their car (if they have one) \u2026this is where the \u201cpayroll taxes\u201d originate.\u00a0 A place such as a Thrift-Store \u201cchain\u201d (they differ from local area to area) employs people at minimum wage and keeps them at under full-time hours to deny them any benefits with little more than \u201csweat shop\u201d conditions, and the management and the directors, of course, make the salaries.</p>\n<p>The government turns a blind eye to all of it, because there are still taxes to be generated from payroll taxes withheld: The Rube Goldberg perpetual taxation machine/hamster wheel.\u00a0 There are also \u201chandout\u201d programs that run hand-in-hand between government and NPO\u2019s, such as tax breaks for the NPO\u2019s for hiring veterans, or the mentally handicapped, as well as any \u201creformed\u201d alcoholics, drug addicts, or criminals placed within the \u201cprogram\u201d by the state or local government.\u00a0 In this manner, the directorate \u201cpads\u201d their salaries and steals more by justifying it through the omnipotent \u201coperating expenses\u201d category.</p>\n<p>The original purpose for NPO\u2019s was to provide some worthwhile service for the community (such as restoration of public buildings, or helping victims of natural disasters, or with education.\u00a0 They had to do with true community service and volunteer effort in a manner that would harness resources and enable people and communities to eliminate bureaucracy from action.\u00a0 In addition, a semi \u201cself-supportive\u201d organization would be formed\u2026not to rake in the millions, but to accomplish projects outside of the normal business spectrum.</p>\n<p>NPO\u2019s were also for <u>protecting</u> religious institutions\u2026certainly not for shielding the \u201cmega-hucksters\u201d raking in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and being chauffeured back and forth from mega-churches to their Lear jets, a full complement of armed bodyguards throwing rose-petals along the way.\u00a0 The NPO\u2019s in this case were intended for a church/synagogue/religious institution to stay solvent, untaxed, and unharassed by government in what they garnered for their attendees in funds, resources, and property.\u00a0 The 501(c)(3) was not to germinate \u201cWolves of Wall Street\u201d in sheep\u2019s clothing preying on their congregants financially.\u00a0 The NPO was not designed to insulate these Wolves and exempt them from obligations (financial or otherwise) to a government that still extracts payroll taxes for anyone working for the Wolves\u2026in a 9-5 \u201cjob\u201d for the religious institution.</p><div

Leaders of the organization have loose ties to George Soros, the\u00a0billionaire hedge fund manager who bankrolls liberal causes, according to the Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank that investigates nonprofits.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cIndivisible is ultra-slick leftist astroturf activism at its finest,\u201d Matthew Vadum, senior vice president at the Capital Research Center, told The Daily Signal in an email. \u201cAt least three of the group\u2019s five principals\u2014Ezra Levin, Leah Greenberg, and Angel Padilla\u2014have ties to organizations funded by George Soros. Indivisible is apparently not yet a nonprofit, but plans are in the works to register it as a nonprofit.\u201d</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>According to Vadum\u2019s research:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Ezra Levin, a former staffer for Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, and his wife, Leah Greenberg, are the president and vice president of the Indivisible Guide\u2019s board, respectively.\u00a0 Levin is also associate director of the Corporation for Enterprise Development, an anti-poverty nonprofit. Melissa Bradley, who sits on that group\u2019s board, previously worked for Green for All, a group founded by liberal commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones. She was appointed as a Soros Justice Fellow through the Open Society Foundations, which Soros founded.\u00a0 Greenberg previously worked for Humanity United, which is funded by Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>The secretary of Indivisible Guide, Angel Padilla, works for the National Immigration Law Center, which is funded by Soros through his Open Society Foundations. And treasurer Matt Traidi is the research team director for the Service Employees International Union, a major donor to and endorser of Democrat politicians, Capital Research Center notes.</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Soros has been responsible for actively toppling more than half a dozen different governments.\u00a0 We are not addressing all the evils of NPO\u2019s, however, all of these \u201cGrand Wizards\u201d who term themselves \u201cboard members\u201d or \u201cdirectors\u201d all operate straight out of Alinsky\u2019s \u201cRules for Radicals.\u201d\u00a0 They are all \u201corganizing the organized,\u201d in that they take an organization (either existing or one that they\u2019ve created), and use the organization\u2019s framework and legal status (in this case the 501(c)(3) shield-format) to develop their minions and cadre, and march them in the direction toward their end goals.\u00a0 In the meantime, they turn a tidy profit for themselves, enjoy \u201cfavored\u201d status by politicos and other enablers, and continue growing an organization.</p>\n<p>In the end, the little minions on the sweatshop floors do not even understand what their function is.\u00a0 They\u2019re just working day-by-day, exploited in the usual manner, and also exploited for their numbers and support unknowingly in a game that is designed to overthrow the existing social, cultural, political, and religious normative practices of our society.\u00a0 The end goal is to destroy the Constitution and subvert the country.\u00a0 Are all NPO\u2019s this way? No, certainly not.\u00a0 But the majority are, and this is one of the things that needs to be addressed by the current administration and Congress, brought to light by We the People\u2026to keep Soros and his ilk from taking us in the direction that other countries have been taken\u2026and at taxpayer expense, with the 501(c)(3) as their shield.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Jeremiah Johnson is the Nom de plume of a retired Green Beret of the United States Army Special Forces (Airborne).\u00a0 Mr. Johnson is also a Gunsmith, a Certified Master Herbalist, a Montana Master Food Preserver, and a graduate of the U.S. Army\u2019s SERE school (Survival Evasion Resistance Escape).\u00a0 He lives in a cabin in the mountains of Western Montana with his wife and three cats.

They present a problem when they can be used by an unscrupulous individual or groups of unscrupulous individuals (for examples, a George Soros, or the Democratic Party respectively). What is an NPO? Let\u2019s look at what they are and see if the definition is characterized by actual NPO actions.\n\nHere is an excerpt from a book that describes NPO\u2019s (what they should be):\n\n\u201cThe main financial difference between a for-profit and a not-for-profit enterprise is what happens to the profit. In a for-profit company like Ford or Microsoft or Disney or your favorite fast-food establishment, profits are paid to the owners, including shareholders. But a nonprofit can\u2019t do that. Any profit remaining after the bills are paid has to be plowed back into the organization\u2019s service program. So profit can\u2019t be distributed to individuals, such as the organization\u2019s board of directors, who are volunteers in every sense of the word.\u201d \u201c Nonprofit Kit for Dummies ,\u201d ISBN: 0-7645-5347-X, pg. 8\n\nAustere and stoic, these NPO\u2019s, all! Ahh, but what is conveniently left out is the salary portion \u2026for the directors. Those salaries are written off as an operating expense by the \u201cNon-Profit,\u201d but they\u2019re hardly the funds gleaned by a \u201csimple volunteer for the beneficent NPO.\u201d Another paragraph from the book shows this:\n\n\u2026for the most part, we\u2019re talking about an organization that the Internal Revenue Service has classified as a 501(c)(3). They receive exemption from federal income taxes and sometimes relief from property taxes at the local level. Nonprofit organizations classified as 501(c)(3) receive extra privileges under the law. They are, with minor exceptions, the only group of tax-exempt organizations that can receive tax-deductible contributions from individuals and organizations. Being a nonprofit organization does not mean that an entity is exempt from paying all taxes. Nonprofit organizations pay employment taxes just like for-profit businesses do. In some states, but not all, nonprofits are exempt from paying sales tax\u2026\u201d Ibid., p. 9\n\nSo, we have some of the basic parameters here for NPO\u2019s. We\u2019re not going to delve into the different types, such as politically-organized, or the religious-type of NPO\u2019s. I draw the reader\u2019s attention to the simple fact that (as mentioned in the last paragraph) the NPO\u2019s \u201cpay employment taxes just like for-profit businesses do.\u201d How wonderfully utopian and egalitarian that sounds, all under the \u201ccolor of law!\u201d The reality is far from it. Directors of NPO\u2019s make six-figure salaries, and all their \u201cbennies\u201d (that\u2019s benefits, not Benzedrine\u2026well, we hope!) are little perks they take and write off as the almighty \u201coperating expense.\u201d\n\nThey can\u2019t very well wear down their cars driving back and forth to the NPO-location, or conducting NPO business, can they? What they do have, as attested by the \u201cpay employment taxes\u201d phrase is a willing army of misfortunates they pay little more than enough to obtain dog food and perhaps live out of their car (if they have one) \u2026this is where the \u201cpayroll taxes\u201d originate. A place such as a Thrift-Store \u201cchain\u201d (they differ from local area to area) employs people at minimum wage and keeps them at under full-time hours to deny them any benefits with little more than \u201csweat shop\u201d conditions, and the management and the directors, of course, make the salaries.\n\nThe government turns a blind eye to all of it, because there are still taxes to be generated from payroll taxes withheld: The Rube Goldberg perpetual taxation machine/hamster wheel. There are also \u201chandout\u201d programs that run hand-in-hand between government and NPO\u2019s, such as tax breaks for the NPO\u2019s for hiring veterans, or the mentally handicapped, as well as any \u201creformed\u201d alcoholics, drug addicts, or criminals placed within the \u201cprogram\u201d by the state or local government. In this manner, the directorate \u201cpads\u201d their salaries and steals more by justifying it through the omnipotent \u201coperating expenses\u201d category.\n\nThe original purpose for NPO\u2019s was to provide some worthwhile service for the community (such as restoration of public buildings, or helping victims of natural disasters, or with education. They had to do with true community service and volunteer effort in a manner that would harness resources and enable people and communities to eliminate bureaucracy from action. In addition, a semi \u201cself-supportive\u201d organization would be formed\u2026not to rake in the millions, but to accomplish projects outside of the normal business spectrum.\n\nNPO\u2019s were also for protecting religious institutions\u2026certainly not for shielding the \u201cmega-hucksters\u201d raking in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and being chauffeured back and forth from mega-churches to their Lear jets, a full complement of armed bodyguards throwing rose-petals along the way. The NPO\u2019s in this case were intended for a church/synagogue/religious institution to stay solvent, untaxed, and unharassed by government in what they garnered for their attendees in funds, resources, and property. The 501(c)(3) was not to germinate \u201cWolves of Wall Street\u201d in sheep\u2019s clothing preying on their congregants financially. The NPO was not designed to insulate these Wolves and exempt them from obligations (financial or otherwise) to a government that still extracts payroll taxes for anyone working for the Wolves\u2026in a 9-5 \u201cjob\u201d for the religious institution.\n\nThe largest \u201cgray area\u201d is with alleged civil rights and civil liberties NPO\u2019s, that strive for \u201cgovernment policy reform,\u201d or \u201ccitizen participation groups.\u201d They wish to overthrow the existing system and society, camouflaging their true beliefs beneath the protective \u201cveil\u201d of \u201cPublic/Societal Benefit\u201d for the establishment of the 501(c)(3).\n\nEnter Soros, the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, and all these other Communists who hide their \u201ccontributions\u201d and utilize their resources [Their \u201cright\u201d to do so protected under the Constitution, mind you] toward overthrowing the Constitution and the society. These NPO\u2019s are not limited to operation domestically, but can operate in foreign countries\u2026under the \u201cfriendly international relations\u201d shield, as they develop Marxist cadre and supporters in other countries they also want to see overthrown.\n\nRecently an article came out entitled Indivisible, with Ties to George Soros, Sows Division Against Trump, GOP Lawmakers, by Fred Lucas. This article presents the perfect example of Communist agitators hiding behind the NPO shield; these agitators are not yet registered as an NPO, but they plan on it. Here are some excerpts:\n\nThey call their group Indivisible Guide, a name that came from an actual guide posted online telling activists how to pressure members of Congress. Among topics: what to say when going to town halls and calling or visiting a member\u2019s office. Leaders of the organization have loose ties to George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager who bankrolls liberal causes, according to the Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank that investigates nonprofits. \u201cIndivisible is ultra-slick leftist astroturf activism at its finest,\u201d Matthew Vadum, senior vice president at the Capital Research Center, told The Daily Signal in an email. \u201cAt least three of the group\u2019s five principals\u2014Ezra Levin, Leah Greenberg, and Angel Padilla\u2014have ties to organizations funded by George Soros. Indivisible is apparently not yet a nonprofit, but plans are in the works to register it as a nonprofit.\u201d According to Vadum\u2019s research: Ezra Levin, a former staffer for Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, and his wife, Leah Greenberg, are the president and vice president of the Indivisible Guide\u2019s board, respectively. Levin is also associate director of the Corporation for Enterprise Development, an anti-poverty nonprofit. Melissa Bradley, who sits on that group\u2019s board, previously worked for Green for All, a group founded by liberal commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones. She was appointed as a Soros Justice Fellow through the Open Society Foundations, which Soros founded. Greenberg previously worked for Humanity United, which is funded by Soros\u2019s Open Society Institute. The secretary of Indivisible Guide, Angel Padilla, works for the National Immigration Law Center, which is funded by Soros through his Open Society Foundations. And treasurer Matt Traidi is the research team director for the Service Employees International Union, a major donor to and endorser of Democrat politicians, Capital Research Center notes.\n\nSoros has been responsible for actively toppling more than half a dozen different governments. We are not addressing all the evils of NPO\u2019s, however, all of these \u201cGrand Wizards\u201d who term themselves \u201cboard members\u201d or \u201cdirectors\u201d all operate straight out of Alinsky\u2019s \u201cRules for Radicals.\u201d They are all \u201corganizing the organized,\u201d in that they take an organization (either existing or one that they\u2019ve created), and use the organization\u2019s framework and legal status (in this case the 501(c)(3) shield-format) to develop their minions and cadre, and march them in the direction toward their end goals. In the meantime, they turn a tidy profit for themselves, enjoy \u201cfavored\u201d status by politicos and other enablers, and continue growing an organization.\n\nIn the end, the little minions on the sweatshop floors do not even understand what their function is. They\u2019re just working day-by-day, exploited in the usual manner, and also exploited for their numbers and support unknowingly in a game that is designed to overthrow the existing social, cultural, political, and religious normative practices of our society. The end goal is to destroy the Constitution and subvert the country. Are all NPO\u2019s this way? No, certainly not. But the majority are, and this is one of the things that needs to be addressed by the current administration and Congress, brought to light by We the People\u2026to keep Soros and his ilk from taking us in the direction that other countries have been taken\u2026and at taxpayer expense, with the 501(c)(3) as their shield.\n\nJeremiah Johnson is the Nom de plume of a retired Green Beret of the United States Army Special Forces (Airborne).
