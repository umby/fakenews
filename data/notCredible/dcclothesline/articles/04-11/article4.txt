War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes\u2026 known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few.\u2026 No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare. \u2014 James Madison</p></blockquote>\n<p><span id=\"more-71481\"></span></p>\n<p>Waging endless wars abroad (in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and now Syria) isn\u2019t making America\u2014or the rest of the world\u2014any safer, it\u2019s certainly not making America great again, and it\u2019s undeniably digging the U.S. deeper into debt.</p>\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s a wonder the economy hasn\u2019t collapsed yet.</p>\n<p>Indeed, even if we were to put an end to <em>all</em> of the government\u2019s military meddling and bring <em>all</em> of the troops home today, it would take decades to pay down the price of these wars and get the government\u2019s creditors off our backs. Even then, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/just-explain-it/just-explain-long-payoff-u-debt-145729149.html\">government spending would have to be slashed</a> dramatically and taxes raised.</p>\n<p>You do the math.</p>\n<p><strong>The government is $19 trillion in debt:</strong> War spending has ratcheted up the nation\u2019s debt. The debt has now exceeded a <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/the-u-s-debt-and-how-it-got-so-big-3305778\">staggering $19 trillion</a> and is growing at an alarming rate of <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/just-explain-it/just-explain-long-payoff-u-debt-145729149.html\">$35 million/hour and $2 billion every 24 hours</a>. \u00a0Yet while <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/03/10/10-companies-profiting-most-from-war/1970997/\">defense contractors are getting richer</a> than their wildest dreams, we\u2019re in hock to foreign nations <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/16/investing/china-japan-us-debt-treasuries/\">such as Japan and China</a> (our two largest foreign holders at $1.13 trillion and $1.12 trillion respectively).</p>\n<p><strong>The Pentagon\u2019s annual budget consumes </strong><a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/3/27/1371191/-Did-You-Know-That-Almost-Every-Penny-Of-Your-Income-Taxes-Goes-To-Defense-Spending\"><strong>almost 100% of individual income tax revenue</strong></a><strong>.</strong> If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off, especially when it comes to paying the tab for America\u2019s attempts to police the globe. Having been co-opted by greedy defense contractors, corrupt politicians and incompetent government officials, America\u2019s expanding military empire is bleeding the country dry at a rate of more than <a href=\"https://www.nationalpriorities.org/cost-of/\">$57 million per hour</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The government has spent $4.8 trillion on wars abroad since 9/11, with $7.9 trillion in interest:</strong> That\u2019s a tax burden of more than $16,000 per American. Almost a quarter of that debt was incurred as a result of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan and Syria. For the past 16 years, <a href=\"http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/economic\">these wars have been paid for almost entirely by borrowing</a> money from foreign nations and the U.S. Treasury. As the <em>Atlantic </em>points out, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/09/cost-wars-iraq-afghanistan/499007/\">we\u2019re fighting terrorism with a credit card</a>. According to the Watson Institute for Public Affairs at Brown University, interest payments on what we\u2019ve already borrowed for these failed wars could total over <a href=\"http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/economic\">$7.9 trillion by 2053</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The government lost more than $160 billion to waste and fraud by the military and defense contractors:</strong> With paid contractors often outnumbering enlisted combat troops, the American war effort dubbed as the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d has quickly evolved into the \u201ccoalition of the billing,\u201d with American taxpayers forced to cough up billions of dollars for cash bribes, luxury bases, a highway to nowhere, faulty equipment, salaries for so-called \u201cghost soldiers,\u201d and <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/09/contractor-waste-iraq-KBR\">overpriced anything and everything</a> associated with the war effort, including a <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/only-the-pentagon-could-spend-640-on-a-toilet-seat/\">$640 toilet seat and a $7600 coffee pot</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Taxpayers are being forced to pay </strong><a href=\"https://www.nationalpriorities.org/cost-of/foreign-military-assistance/\"><strong>$1.4 million per hour</strong></a><strong> to provide U.S. weapons to countries that can\u2019t afford them.</strong> As <em>Mother Jones </em><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/iraq-military-win-business-not-war\">reports</a>, the Pentagon\u2019s Foreign Military Finance program \u201copens the way for the US government to pay for weapons for other countries\u2014only to \u2018promote world peace,\u2019 of course\u2014using your tax dollars, which are then recycled into the hands of military-industrial-complex corporations.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>The U.S. government </strong><a href=\"http://rare.us/rare-politics/issues/government-run-amok/this-new-map-captures-the-gigantic-size-of-american-military-spending/\"><strong>spends more on wars (and military occupations) abroad every year than all 50 states combined</strong></a><strong> spend on health, education, welfare, and safety.</strong> In fact, the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-budget-countries-politics-president-donald-trump-spending-2017-3\">U.S. spends more on its military than the eight highest-ranking nations</a> with big defense budgets combined. The reach of America\u2019s <a href=\"https://qz.com/374138/these-are-all-the-countries-where-the-us-has-a-military-presence/\">military empire</a> includes close to <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/the-united-states-probably-has-more-foreign-military-bases-than-any-other-people-nation-or-empire-in-history/\">800 bases in as many as 160 countries</a>, operated at a cost of more than $156 billion annually. As investigative journalist David Vine reports, \u201cEven US military resorts and recreation areas in places like the Bavarian Alps and Seoul, South Korea, are bases of a kind. Worldwide, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/the-united-states-probably-has-more-foreign-military-bases-than-any-other-people-nation-or-empire-in-history/\">the military runs more than 170 golf courses</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Now President Trump wants to </strong><a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/27/trump-promises-rebuilding-armed-forces/\"><strong>increase military spending</strong></a><strong> by $54 billion.</strong> Promising \u201can <a href=\"http://www.counterpunch.org/2017/03/02/trumps-military-industrial-complex/\">historic increase in defense spending</a> to rebuild the depleted military of the United States,\u201d Trump has made it clear where his priorities lie, and it\u2019s not with the American taxpayer. As <em>The Nation</em> <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trump-goes-all-in-for-the-military-industrial-complex/\">reports</a>, \u201cOn a planet where Americans account for 4.34 percent of the population, US military spending accounts for <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trump-goes-all-in-for-the-military-industrial-complex/\">37 percent of the global total</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Add in the cost of waging war in Syria (with or without congressional approval), and the burden on taxpayers soars to more than </strong><a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/how-much-has-syrian-civil-war-cost-russia-us-2336199\"><strong>$11.5 million a day</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Ironically, while presidential candidate Trump was vehemently <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/seven-lessons-from-trumps-syria-strike/522327/\">opposed to the U.S. use of force in Syria</a>, as well as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/06/15/482184991/fact-check-donald-trump-and-syrian-refugees\">harboring Syrian refugees</a> within the U.S., he had no problem retaliating against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/07/politics/clinton-trump-syria-refugees/\">on behalf of Syrian children</a> killed in a chemical attack. The cost of launching a 59 Tomahawk missile-strike against Syria? It\u2019s estimated that the missiles alone cost <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-how-much-it-will-cost-to-replace-the-tomahawks-used-in-syria-2017-04-07\">$60 million</a>. Mind you, this is the same man, while campaigning for president, who warned that fighting Syria would <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/seven-lessons-from-trumps-syria-strike/522327/\">signal the start of World War III</a> against a united Syria, Russia and Iran. Already <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN17905I\">oil prices have started to climb</a> as investors anticipate an extended conflict.</p>\n<p>Clearly, war has become a huge money-making venture, and the U.S. government, with its vast military empire, is one of its best buyers and sellers.</p>\n<p>Yet what most Americans\u2014brainwashed into believing that patriotism means supporting the war machine\u2014fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense.</p>\n<p>The rationale may keep changing for why American military forces are in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and now Syria. However, the one that remains constant is that those who run the government\u2014including the current president\u2014are feeding the appetite of the military industrial complex and fattening the bank accounts of its investors.</p>\n<p>Case in point: President Trump plans to \u201cbeef up\u201d military spending while <a href=\"http://time.com/money/4639544/trump-nea-sesame-street-budget-cut/\">slashing funding</a> for the environment, civil rights protections, the arts, minority-owned businesses, public broadcasting, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4320900/New-budget-cuts-rural-airports-long-distance-trains.html\">Amtrak, rural airports and interstates</a>.</p>\n<p>In other words, in order to fund this burgeoning military empire that polices the globe, the U.S. government is prepared to bankrupt the nation, jeopardize our servicemen and women, increase the chances of terrorism and blowback domestically, and push the nation that much closer to eventual collapse.</p>\n<p>Clearly, our national priorities are in desperate need of an <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0607-lopez-fallingapart-20150606-column.html\">overhauling</a>.</p>\n<p>As <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reporter Steve Lopez rightly asks:</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0607-lopez-fallingapart-20150606-column.html\">Why throw money at defense when everything is falling down around us?</a> Do we need to spend more money on our military (about $600 billion this year) than the next seven countries combined? Do we need 1.4 million active military personnel and 850,000 reserves when the enemy at the moment \u2014 ISIS \u2014 numbers in the low tens of thousands? If so, it seems there\u2019s something radically wrong with our strategy. Should 55% of the federal government\u2019s discretionary spending go to the military and only 3% to transportation when the toll in American lives is far greater from failing infrastructure than from terrorism? Does California need nearly as many active military bases (31, according to militarybases.com) as it has UC and state university campuses (33)? And does the state need more active duty military personnel (168,000, according to Governing magazine) than public elementary school teachers (139,000)?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, there are much better uses for your taxpayer funds than trillions of dollars being wasted on war. The following are just a few ways those hard-earned dollars could be used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-0607-lopez-fallingapart-20150606-column.html\">$270 billion to repair U.S. public schools</a>, and twice that much to modernize them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>$120 billion a year to fix the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.

This figure doesn\u2019t include the hundreds of billions spent each year on maintaining the U.S. military presence around the globe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As long as \u201cwe the people\u201d continue to allow the government to wage its costly, meaningless, endless wars abroad, the American homeland will continue to suffer: our roads will crumble, our bridges will fail, our schools will fall into disrepair, our drinking water will become undrinkable, our communities will destabilize, and crime will rise.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the kicker, though: if the American economy collapses\u2014and with it the last vestiges of our constitutional republic\u2014it will be the government and its trillion-dollar war budgets that are to blame.</p>\n<p>Of course, the government has already anticipated this breakdown.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why the government has transformed America into a war zone, turned the nation into a surveillance state, and labelled \u201cwe the people\u201d as enemy combatants.</p>\n<p>For years now, the government has worked with the military to <a href=\"http://rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/coming_soon_to_a_city_near_you_the_u.s._militarys_plan_to_take_over_am\">prepare for widespread civil unrest</a> brought about by \u201ceconomic collapse,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/news/2008/Report_Military_may_have_to_quell_1229.html\">loss of functioning political and legal order</a>, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Having spent more than half a century exporting war to foreign lands, profiting from war, and creating a national economy seemingly dependent on the spoils of war, the war hawks long ago turned their profit-driven appetites on us, bringing home the spoils of war\u2014the military tanks, grenade launchers, Kevlar helmets, assault rifles, gas masks, ammunition, battering rams, night vision binoculars, etc.\u2014and handing them over to local police, thereby turning America into a battlefield.</p>\n<p>This is how the police state wins and \u201cwe the people\u201d lose.</p>\n<p>Eventually, however, as I make clear in my book\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Battlefield-America-War-American-People/dp/1590793099/\"><em>Battlefield America: The War on the American People</em></a>, all military empires fail.</p>\n<p>At the height of its power, even the mighty Roman Empire could not stare down a collapsing economy and a burgeoning military. Prolonged periods of war and false economic prosperity largely led to its demise. As historian Chalmers Johnson predicts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The fate of previous democratic empires suggests that such a conflict is unsustainable and will be resolved in one of two ways. <a href=\"http://archive.li/Ts2SF\">Rome attempted to keep its empire and lost its democracy.</a> Britain chose to remain democratic and in the process let go its empire. Intentionally or not, the people of the United States already are well embarked upon the course of non-democratic empire.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is the \u201cunwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex\u201d that President Dwight Eisenhower warned us more than 50 years ago not to let endanger our liberties or democratic processes. Eisenhower, who served as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe during World War II, was alarmed by the rise of the profit-driven war machine that emerged following the war\u2014one that, in order to perpetuate itself, would have to keep waging war.</p>\n<p>We failed to heed his warning.</p>\n<p>Yet as <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trump-goes-all-in-for-the-military-industrial-complex/\">Eisenhower recognized</a>, the consequences of allowing the military-industrial complex to wage war, exhaust our resources and dictate our national priorities are beyond grave:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway. We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wake up, America.

War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes\u2026 known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few.\u2026 No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare. \u2014 James Madison\n\nWaging endless wars abroad (in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and now Syria) isn\u2019t making America\u2014or the rest of the world\u2014any safer, it\u2019s certainly not making America great again, and it\u2019s undeniably digging the U.S. deeper into debt.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a wonder the economy hasn\u2019t collapsed yet.\n\nIndeed, even if we were to put an end to all of the government\u2019s military meddling and bring all of the troops home today, it would take decades to pay down the price of these wars and get the government\u2019s creditors off our backs. Even then, government spending would have to be slashed dramatically and taxes raised.\n\nYou do the math.\n\nThe government is $19 trillion in debt: War spending has ratcheted up the nation\u2019s debt. The debt has now exceeded a staggering $19 trillion and is growing at an alarming rate of $35 million/hour and $2 billion every 24 hours. Yet while defense contractors are getting richer than their wildest dreams, we\u2019re in hock to foreign nations such as Japan and China (our two largest foreign holders at $1.13 trillion and $1.12 trillion respectively).\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s annual budget consumes almost 100% of individual income tax revenue. If there is any absolute maxim by which the federal government seems to operate, it is that the American taxpayer always gets ripped off, especially when it comes to paying the tab for America\u2019s attempts to police the globe. Having been co-opted by greedy defense contractors, corrupt politicians and incompetent government officials, America\u2019s expanding military empire is bleeding the country dry at a rate of more than $57 million per hour.\n\nThe government has spent $4.8 trillion on wars abroad since 9/11, with $7.9 trillion in interest: That\u2019s a tax burden of more than $16,000 per American. Almost a quarter of that debt was incurred as a result of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan and Syria. For the past 16 years, these wars have been paid for almost entirely by borrowing money from foreign nations and the U.S. Treasury. As the Atlantic points out, we\u2019re fighting terrorism with a credit card. According to the Watson Institute for Public Affairs at Brown University, interest payments on what we\u2019ve already borrowed for these failed wars could total over $7.9 trillion by 2053.\n\nThe government lost more than $160 billion to waste and fraud by the military and defense contractors: With paid contractors often outnumbering enlisted combat troops, the American war effort dubbed as the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d has quickly evolved into the \u201ccoalition of the billing,\u201d with American taxpayers forced to cough up billions of dollars for cash bribes, luxury bases, a highway to nowhere, faulty equipment, salaries for so-called \u201cghost soldiers,\u201d and overpriced anything and everything associated with the war effort, including a $640 toilet seat and a $7600 coffee pot.\n\nTaxpayers are being forced to pay $1.4 million per hour to provide U.S. weapons to countries that can\u2019t afford them. As Mother Jones reports, the Pentagon\u2019s Foreign Military Finance program \u201copens the way for the US government to pay for weapons for other countries\u2014only to \u2018promote world peace,\u2019 of course\u2014using your tax dollars, which are then recycled into the hands of military-industrial-complex corporations.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. government spends more on wars (and military occupations) abroad every year than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. In fact, the U.S. spends more on its military than the eight highest-ranking nations with big defense budgets combined. The reach of America\u2019s military empire includes close to 800 bases in as many as 160 countries, operated at a cost of more than $156 billion annually. As investigative journalist David Vine reports, \u201cEven US military resorts and recreation areas in places like the Bavarian Alps and Seoul, South Korea, are bases of a kind. Worldwide, the military runs more than 170 golf courses.\u201d\n\nNow President Trump wants to increase military spending by $54 billion. Promising \u201can historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States,\u201d Trump has made it clear where his priorities lie, and it\u2019s not with the American taxpayer. As The Nation reports, \u201cOn a planet where Americans account for 4.34 percent of the population, US military spending accounts for 37 percent of the global total.\u201d\n\nAdd in the cost of waging war in Syria (with or without congressional approval), and the burden on taxpayers soars to more than $11.5 million a day. Ironically, while presidential candidate Trump was vehemently opposed to the U.S. use of force in Syria, as well as harboring Syrian refugees within the U.S., he had no problem retaliating against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on behalf of Syrian children killed in a chemical attack. The cost of launching a 59 Tomahawk missile-strike against Syria? It\u2019s estimated that the missiles alone cost $60 million. Mind you, this is the same man, while campaigning for president, who warned that fighting Syria would signal the start of World War III against a united Syria, Russia and Iran. Already oil prices have started to climb as investors anticipate an extended conflict.\n\nClearly, war has become a huge money-making venture, and the U.S. government, with its vast military empire, is one of its best buyers and sellers.\n\nYet what most Americans\u2014brainwashed into believing that patriotism means supporting the war machine\u2014fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense.\n\nThe rationale may keep changing for why American military forces are in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and now Syria. However, the one that remains constant is that those who run the government\u2014including the current president\u2014are feeding the appetite of the military industrial complex and fattening the bank accounts of its investors.\n\nCase in point: President Trump plans to \u201cbeef up\u201d military spending while slashing funding for the environment, civil rights protections, the arts, minority-owned businesses, public broadcasting, Amtrak, rural airports and interstates.\n\nIn other words, in order to fund this burgeoning military empire that polices the globe, the U.S. government is prepared to bankrupt the nation, jeopardize our servicemen and women, increase the chances of terrorism and blowback domestically, and push the nation that much closer to eventual collapse.\n\nClearly, our national priorities are in desperate need of an overhauling.\n\nAs Los Angeles Times reporter Steve Lopez rightly asks:\n\nWhy throw money at defense when everything is falling down around us? Do we need to spend more money on our military (about $600 billion this year) than the next seven countries combined? Do we need 1.4 million active military personnel and 850,000 reserves when the enemy at the moment \u2014 ISIS \u2014 numbers in the low tens of thousands? If so, it seems there\u2019s something radically wrong with our strategy. Should 55% of the federal government\u2019s discretionary spending go to the military and only 3% to transportation when the toll in American lives is far greater from failing infrastructure than from terrorism? Does California need nearly as many active military bases (31, according to militarybases.com) as it has UC and state university campuses (33)? And does the state need more active duty military personnel (168,000, according to Governing magazine) than public elementary school teachers (139,000)?\n\nObviously, there are much better uses for your taxpayer funds than trillions of dollars being wasted on war. The following are just a few ways those hard-earned dollars could be used:\n\n$270 billion to repair U.S. public schools, and twice that much to modernize them.\n\n$120 billion a year to fix the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. With 32% of the nation\u2019s major roadways in poor or mediocre condition, it\u2019s estimated that improving the nation\u2019s roads and bridges would require $120 billion a year through 2020, although it will take \u201cmany trillions \u2026 to fix the country\u2019s web of roads, bridges, railways, subways and bus stations.\u201d\n\n$251 million for safety improvements and construction for Amtrak.\n\n$690 million to care for America\u2019s 70,000 aging veterans.\n\n$11 billion wasted or lost in Iraq in just one year could have paid 220,000 teachers\u2019 salaries.\n\nThe yearly cost of stationing just one soldier in Iraq could have fed 60 American families.\n\n$30 billion per year to end starvation and hunger around the world.\n\n$11 billion per year to provide the world\u2014including our own failing cities\u2014with clean drinking water.\n\nUse the $10 billion spent every year to provide arms, equipment, training and advice internationally to more than 180 countries to start paying down the overwhelming $19 trillion national debt. This figure doesn\u2019t include the hundreds of billions spent each year on maintaining the U.S. military presence around the globe.\n\nAs long as \u201cwe the people\u201d continue to allow the government to wage its costly, meaningless, endless wars abroad, the American homeland will continue to suffer: our roads will crumble, our bridges will fail, our schools will fall into disrepair, our drinking water will become undrinkable, our communities will destabilize, and crime will rise.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, though: if the American economy collapses\u2014and with it the last vestiges of our constitutional republic\u2014it will be the government and its trillion-dollar war budgets that are to blame.\n\nOf course, the government has already anticipated this breakdown.\n\nThat\u2019s why the government has transformed America into a war zone, turned the nation into a surveillance state, and labelled \u201cwe the people\u201d as enemy combatants.\n\nFor years now, the government has worked with the military to prepare for widespread civil unrest brought about by \u201ceconomic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters.\u201d\n\nHaving spent more than half a century exporting war to foreign lands, profiting from war, and creating a national economy seemingly dependent on the spoils of war, the war hawks long ago turned their profit-driven appetites on us, bringing home the spoils of war\u2014the military tanks, grenade launchers, Kevlar helmets, assault rifles, gas masks, ammunition, battering rams, night vision binoculars, etc.\u2014and handing them over to local police, thereby turning America into a battlefield.\n\nThis is how the police state wins and \u201cwe the people\u201d lose.\n\nEventually, however, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, all military empires fail.\n\nAt the height of its power, even the mighty Roman Empire could not stare down a collapsing economy and a burgeoning military. Prolonged periods of war and false economic prosperity largely led to its demise. As historian Chalmers Johnson predicts:\n\nThe fate of previous democratic empires suggests that such a conflict is unsustainable and will be resolved in one of two ways. Rome attempted to keep its empire and lost its democracy. Britain chose to remain democratic and in the process let go its empire. Intentionally or not, the people of the United States already are well embarked upon the course of non-democratic empire.\n\nThis is the \u201cunwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex\u201d that President Dwight Eisenhower warned us more than 50 years ago not to let endanger our liberties or democratic processes. Eisenhower, who served as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe during World War II, was alarmed by the rise of the profit-driven war machine that emerged following the war\u2014one that, in order to perpetuate itself, would have to keep waging war.\n\nWe failed to heed his warning.\n\nYet as Eisenhower recognized, the consequences of allowing the military-industrial complex to wage war, exhaust our resources and dictate our national priorities are beyond grave:\n\nEvery gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway. We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.\n\nWake up, America. There\u2019s not much time left before we reach the zero hour.\n\nConstitutional attorney and author John W.
