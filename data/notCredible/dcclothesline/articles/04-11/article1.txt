Here I\u2019m going to use a Q &amp; A format to highlight vital points.<span id=\"more-71495\"></span></p>\n<p>Q: What do people need to know about names for diseases?</p>\n<p>A: A disease-label of any kind is something you need to look at the way you\u2019d look at a scorpion on your porch.</p>\n<p>Q: Why?</p>\n<p>A: Because the label is meant to make you think there is a specific condition.</p>\n<p>Q: Isn\u2019t that the case?</p>\n<p>A: Not necessarily. For example, autism.</p>\n<p>Q: Isn\u2019t autism a specific condition?</p>\n<p>A: No.</p>\n<p>Q: Why not?</p>\n<p>A: Well, start with this. There is no defining diagnostic test for autism. No defining physical test. No blood test, saliva test, urine test, brain scan, genetic assay.</p>\n<p>Q: That\u2019s impossible.</p>\n<p>A: It\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>Q: How can that be?</p>\n<p>A: Autism is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the bible of the psychiatric profession. The definition of autism is basically a menu of behaviors. There is no defining diagnostic test. You\u2019ll find, in the official lexicon, other names for various so-called \u201cdevelopmental neurological disorders,\u201d too. And none of them in the DSM have defining diagnostic tests, either.</p>\n<p>Q: What are you driving at? Are you saying autism is some kind of illusion, that there is no damage or problem?</p>\n<p>A: Of course not. Of course there is damage.</p>\n<p>Q: So what is your point?</p>\n<p>A: If a parent applies to the US federal vaccine court, for compensation, because her child was severely damaged by a vaccine, and if she or her doctor calls that damage \u201cautism,\u201d there is almost no chance the government will award her compensation.</p>\n<p>Q: Why?</p>\n<p>A: Because the government is committed to saying, come hell or high water, vaccines don\u2019t cause autism. But if that same parent says her child developed \u201cencephalopathy\u201d\u2014a generalized term meaning a condition that adversely affects the structure or function of the brain\u2014her chances of receiving compensation increase by a small percentage.</p>\n<p>Q: Even if she says a vaccine caused the encephalopathy?</p>\n<p>A: Yes. It\u2019s all a word game, and if the parent doesn\u2019t know how to play it, she\u2019ll almost certainly lose.</p>\n<p>Q: That\u2019s ridiculous.</p>\n<p>A: Indeed it is.</p>\n<p>Q: If none of these neurological disease-labels in the DSM has a specific and defining diagnostic test, then why doesn\u2019t the parent just tell the vaccine court, \u201cMy child\u2019s brain was damaged by a vaccine\u201d?</p>\n<p>A: Because the rules demand that she present evidence that the vaccine caused a known and officially accepted disease condition with a disease label.</p>\n<p>Q: But the truth is, the vaccine caused brain damage.</p>\n<p>A: Truth is not the goal of the government\u2019s game.</p>\n<p>Q: Are you saying there is no such thing as autism?</p>\n<p>A: I\u2019m saying there is no conclusive evidence for the existence of autism as a specific condition. Otherwise, there would be a defining diagnostic test for it, and there isn\u2019t. There are various causes for neurological and brain damage. When a vaccine is the cause, it should be called VACCINE DAMAGE, and compensation should be awarded on that basis. Period. Stop the fiddling and game playing.</p>\n<p>Q: But the government doesn\u2019t want to admit that vaccines cause severe damage.</p>\n<p>A: That\u2019s why they play their word games.</p>\n<p>Q: What are some causes for neurological damage?</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>A: A blow to the head, a fall, almost drowning in a pool, oxygen deprivation at birth, severe and long-term nutritional deficits, toxic pesticides, toxic medical drugs, vaccines.</p>\n<p>Q: Why are these and other causes hidden under fancy medical names?</p>\n<p>A: Because, for example, for each disease-name, drugs can be developed and sold.</p>\n<p>Q: What are some names for neurological disease or damage?</p>\n<p>A: Fragile X syndrome, Asperger, Rett syndrome; Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Intellectual Disability, autism.</p>\n<p>Q: Are there overlaps of symptoms?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Q: Is it possible that any of these could be caused by vaccines?</p>\n<p>A: The actual DAMAGE that is at the heart of these disease-labels could be caused by vaccines. Or other factors. Each child must be assessed uniquely.</p>\n<p>Q: You\u2019re suggesting that, in a sane world, parents and doctors and government officials would call vaccine damage VACCINE DAMAGE, and forget all the rest of it.</p>\n<p>A: Neurological vaccine damage, yes. Because that\u2019s what it is. You can say, \u201cWell, we think this group of nerve cells is affected or that group is affected, or possibly this part of the brain is affected or that part,\u201d but when a vaccine is the cause, it\u2019s vaccine damage, plain and simple.</p>\n<p>Q: Any other medical tricks people should be aware of, relating to autism?</p>\n<p>A: Yes. Researchers can say they know vaccines don\u2019t cause autism, because there are children diagnosed with autism who have never been vaccinated. That assertion is a hoax. The label and the definition of autism are worthless, to begin with, because there is no specific test that invariably diagnoses autism. Instead, as I keep saying, vaccine damage is real and it should be labeled as such. Then, there is no argument about what is and isn\u2019t autism, or what does and doesn\u2019t cause it. There is just naked straightforward truth.</p>\n<p>Q: So when a doctor tells a parent, \u201cYour child has autism\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>A: He\u2019s really saying, \u201cYour child has suffered some kind of neurological damage. We have a general label for it. Autism. The label doesn\u2019t tell us what caused your child\u2019s damage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Q: But the doctor wouldn\u2019t admit that.</p>\n<p>A: No, he wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Q: Suppose he did admit that. Suppose all doctors admitted that.</p>\n<p>A: Then there would be a whole new world. Doctors would be tasked with trying to find out what caused the damage in each child. And in talking to a parent, who was there and saw the radical change in her child after vaccination, a doctor would realize that a vaccine was the cause.</p>\n<p>Q: It sounds like the government is leading a parent with a vaccine-damaged child into a blind alley with its vaccine court.</p>\n<p>A: That\u2019s right. The parent is seeking compensation to pay for her child\u2019s care. The court is essentially saying, \u201cIf you claim your child was damaged by a vaccine and call that damage autism, even though the word \u201cautism\u201d is just a meaningless label, we\u2019ll deny compensation. We\u2019ll deny it because we\u2019ve arbitrarily decided that vaccines can\u2019t cause autism.\u201d</p>\n<p>Q: This is pure insanity.</p>\n<p>A: Yes, cruel insanity.</p>\n<p>Q: Let me see if I can sum all this up. First, we have a meaningless label called \u201cautism.\u201d It\u2019s meaningless because there are no defining diagnostic tests for autism. Therefore, there is no proof that autism is a specific condition, beyond the fact that a child has been neurologically damaged in some way. But most people, and the government, and the medical system, ALL BUY INTO THE IDEA THAT AUTISM IS REAL AND SPECIFIC\u2026AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT TURNS AROUND AND SAYS: A PARENT WHO IS SEEKING COMPENSATION FOR VACCINE DAMAGE, ON THE BASIS THAT A VACCINE CAUSED HER CHILD TO \u201cDEVELOP AUTISM,\u201d WON\u2019T BE COMPENSATED, BECAUSE THERE IS NO PROOF THAT ANY VACCINE CAUSES AUTISM. THE GOVERNMENT IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING: THERE IS NO PROOF A VACCINE CAN CAUSE A CONDITION WHICH HASN\u2019T BEEN PROVEN TO EXIST.</p>\n<p>A: Yes, that\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p>Q: This is even crazier than I thought it was.</p>\n<p>A: You can add in one more factor. There are parents with vaccine-damaged children, and these children have been diagnosed with autism. If you tell these parents there is no proof that autism exists, and their child simply has devastating neurological vaccine damage, they will protest. They\u2019re caught in a situation they don\u2019t fully understand, and they\u2019re determined to hold on to the idea that their child \u201chas autism.\u201d They want that label to be applied to their child. For them, it provides an \u201cexplanation\u201d for what happened to their child. They won\u2019t let it go. And THEN, they will go to the federal vaccine court and ask for compensation, not realizing that if they use the word \u201cautism,\u201d that\u2019s doom. The court will deny their claim.</p>\n<p>Q: It\u2019s like being caught in a maze.</p>\n<p>A: That\u2019s exactly what it is.</p>\n<p><em>Jon Rappoport</em></p>\n<p><em>To read about Jon\u2019s mega-collection, <strong>Power Outside The Matrix</strong>, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/power-outside-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>The author of three explosive collections, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\">THE MATRIX REVEALED</a>, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">EXIT FROM THE MATRIX</a>, and <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/power-outside-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX</a>, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29<sup>th</sup> District of California.

Here I\u2019m going to use a Q & A format to highlight vital points.\n\nQ: What do people need to know about names for diseases?\n\nA: A disease-label of any kind is something you need to look at the way you\u2019d look at a scorpion on your porch.\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA: Because the label is meant to make you think there is a specific condition.\n\nQ: Isn\u2019t that the case?\n\nA: Not necessarily. For example, autism.\n\nQ: Isn\u2019t autism a specific condition?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Why not?\n\nA: Well, start with this. There is no defining diagnostic test for autism. No defining physical test. No blood test, saliva test, urine test, brain scan, genetic assay.\n\nQ: That\u2019s impossible.\n\nA: It\u2019s true.\n\nQ: How can that be?\n\nA: Autism is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the bible of the psychiatric profession. The definition of autism is basically a menu of behaviors. There is no defining diagnostic test. You\u2019ll find, in the official lexicon, other names for various so-called \u201cdevelopmental neurological disorders,\u201d too. And none of them in the DSM have defining diagnostic tests, either.\n\nQ: What are you driving at? Are you saying autism is some kind of illusion, that there is no damage or problem?\n\nA: Of course not. Of course there is damage.\n\nQ: So what is your point?\n\nA: If a parent applies to the US federal vaccine court, for compensation, because her child was severely damaged by a vaccine, and if she or her doctor calls that damage \u201cautism,\u201d there is almost no chance the government will award her compensation.\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA: Because the government is committed to saying, come hell or high water, vaccines don\u2019t cause autism. But if that same parent says her child developed \u201cencephalopathy\u201d\u2014a generalized term meaning a condition that adversely affects the structure or function of the brain\u2014her chances of receiving compensation increase by a small percentage.\n\nQ: Even if she says a vaccine caused the encephalopathy?\n\nA: Yes. It\u2019s all a word game, and if the parent doesn\u2019t know how to play it, she\u2019ll almost certainly lose.\n\nQ: That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nA: Indeed it is.\n\nQ: If none of these neurological disease-labels in the DSM has a specific and defining diagnostic test, then why doesn\u2019t the parent just tell the vaccine court, \u201cMy child\u2019s brain was damaged by a vaccine\u201d?\n\nA: Because the rules demand that she present evidence that the vaccine caused a known and officially accepted disease condition with a disease label.\n\nQ: But the truth is, the vaccine caused brain damage.\n\nA: Truth is not the goal of the government\u2019s game.\n\nQ: Are you saying there is no such thing as autism?\n\nA: I\u2019m saying there is no conclusive evidence for the existence of autism as a specific condition. Otherwise, there would be a defining diagnostic test for it, and there isn\u2019t. There are various causes for neurological and brain damage. When a vaccine is the cause, it should be called VACCINE DAMAGE, and compensation should be awarded on that basis. Period. Stop the fiddling and game playing.\n\nQ: But the government doesn\u2019t want to admit that vaccines cause severe damage.\n\nA: That\u2019s why they play their word games.\n\nQ: What are some causes for neurological damage?\n\nA: A blow to the head, a fall, almost drowning in a pool, oxygen deprivation at birth, severe and long-term nutritional deficits, toxic pesticides, toxic medical drugs, vaccines.\n\nQ: Why are these and other causes hidden under fancy medical names?\n\nA: Because, for example, for each disease-name, drugs can be developed and sold.\n\nQ: What are some names for neurological disease or damage?\n\nA: Fragile X syndrome, Asperger, Rett syndrome; Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Intellectual Disability, autism.\n\nQ: Are there overlaps of symptoms?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Is it possible that any of these could be caused by vaccines?\n\nA: The actual DAMAGE that is at the heart of these disease-labels could be caused by vaccines. Or other factors. Each child must be assessed uniquely.\n\nQ: You\u2019re suggesting that, in a sane world, parents and doctors and government officials would call vaccine damage VACCINE DAMAGE, and forget all the rest of it.\n\nA: Neurological vaccine damage, yes. Because that\u2019s what it is. You can say, \u201cWell, we think this group of nerve cells is affected or that group is affected, or possibly this part of the brain is affected or that part,\u201d but when a vaccine is the cause, it\u2019s vaccine damage, plain and simple.\n\nQ: Any other medical tricks people should be aware of, relating to autism?\n\nA: Yes. Researchers can say they know vaccines don\u2019t cause autism, because there are children diagnosed with autism who have never been vaccinated. That assertion is a hoax. The label and the definition of autism are worthless, to begin with, because there is no specific test that invariably diagnoses autism. Instead, as I keep saying, vaccine damage is real and it should be labeled as such. Then, there is no argument about what is and isn\u2019t autism, or what does and doesn\u2019t cause it. There is just naked straightforward truth.\n\nQ: So when a doctor tells a parent, \u201cYour child has autism\u2026\u201d\n\nA: He\u2019s really saying, \u201cYour child has suffered some kind of neurological damage. We have a general label for it. Autism. The label doesn\u2019t tell us what caused your child\u2019s damage.\u201d\n\nQ: But the doctor wouldn\u2019t admit that.\n\nA: No, he wouldn\u2019t.\n\nQ: Suppose he did admit that. Suppose all doctors admitted that.\n\nA: Then there would be a whole new world. Doctors would be tasked with trying to find out what caused the damage in each child. And in talking to a parent, who was there and saw the radical change in her child after vaccination, a doctor would realize that a vaccine was the cause.\n\nQ: It sounds like the government is leading a parent with a vaccine-damaged child into a blind alley with its vaccine court.\n\nA: That\u2019s right. The parent is seeking compensation to pay for her child\u2019s care. The court is essentially saying, \u201cIf you claim your child was damaged by a vaccine and call that damage autism, even though the word \u201cautism\u201d is just a meaningless label, we\u2019ll deny compensation. We\u2019ll deny it because we\u2019ve arbitrarily decided that vaccines can\u2019t cause autism.\u201d\n\nQ: This is pure insanity.\n\nA: Yes, cruel insanity.\n\nQ: Let me see if I can sum all this up. First, we have a meaningless label called \u201cautism.\u201d It\u2019s meaningless because there are no defining diagnostic tests for autism. Therefore, there is no proof that autism is a specific condition, beyond the fact that a child has been neurologically damaged in some way. But most people, and the government, and the medical system, ALL BUY INTO THE IDEA THAT AUTISM IS REAL AND SPECIFIC\u2026AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT TURNS AROUND AND SAYS: A PARENT WHO IS SEEKING COMPENSATION FOR VACCINE DAMAGE, ON THE BASIS THAT A VACCINE CAUSED HER CHILD TO \u201cDEVELOP AUTISM,\u201d WON\u2019T BE COMPENSATED, BECAUSE THERE IS NO PROOF THAT ANY VACCINE CAUSES AUTISM. THE GOVERNMENT IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING: THERE IS NO PROOF A VACCINE CAN CAUSE A CONDITION WHICH HASN\u2019T BEEN PROVEN TO EXIST.\n\nA: Yes, that\u2019s correct.\n\nQ: This is even crazier than I thought it was.\n\nA: You can add in one more factor. There are parents with vaccine-damaged children, and these children have been diagnosed with autism. If you tell these parents there is no proof that autism exists, and their child simply has devastating neurological vaccine damage, they will protest. They\u2019re caught in a situation they don\u2019t fully understand, and they\u2019re determined to hold on to the idea that their child \u201chas autism.\u201d They want that label to be applied to their child. For them, it provides an \u201cexplanation\u201d for what happened to their child. They won\u2019t let it go. And THEN, they will go to the federal vaccine court and ask for compensation, not realizing that if they use the word \u201cautism,\u201d that\u2019s doom. The court will deny their claim.\n\nQ: It\u2019s like being caught in a maze.\n\nA: That\u2019s exactly what it is.\n\nJon Rappoport\n\nTo read about Jon\u2019s mega-collection, Power Outside The Matrix, click here.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
