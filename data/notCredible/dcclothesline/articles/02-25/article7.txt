Whether or not Trump is aware of this plan cannot yet be proven, but as I have mentioned in the past, his cabinet of Goldman Sachs alumni and neo-con veterans hardly gives me confidence.\u00a0 In the best case scenario, Trump is surrounded by enemies; in the worst case scenario, he is surrounded by friends.</p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s loyalties, though, are a secondary issue for now.\u00a0 The primary focus of this article is to discern whether or not a battle between Trump and the Fed will result in a net positive or a net negative for the public.\u00a0 My position is that any action against the Fed should have happened years ago, and that today, the Fed is nothing more than a sacrificial appendage of a greater globalist agenda.\u00a0 Meaning, conservative groups should be aware that a victory over the Fed is not actually a victory over the globalists.\u00a0 In fact, the globalists may very well WANT a war between the Fed and the White House at this time.</p>\n<p>First, some facts need to be established to counter the propaganda claims that the Fed is some kind of\u00a0 innocent victim of a rampaging President Trump or \u201cmisguided\u201d conservative rhetoric.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Scapegoat Setup Continues</strong></h2>\n<p>The latest extension of the Fed\u2019s propaganda has been initiated, of course, by the mainstream media and liberals in general; you know, the same people that were applauding the (in some cases misguided) efforts of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\u00a0 With Trump\u2019s negation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the media has been looking for any opportunity to assert that Trump is either acting to enrich his corporate friends or that he is an idiot man-child when it comes to matters of business and economics.</p>\n<p>This led to some sniping by Elizabeth Warren and <span class=\"example\">Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen</span>\u2018s testimony before congress last week.\u00a0 The argument?\u00a0 That Trump was wrong or \u201clying\u201d when he said that Dodd-Frank had frozen loans from major banks.\u00a0 You can see the glee in media outlets over the stab; <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/janet-yellen-just-fact-shamed-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">a recent article</a> by Vanity Fair, which seemed to focus more on snide ankle biting of Trump than concrete evidence, is a perfect example.</p>\n<p>Now, in Trump\u2019s defense (or at least, in defense of his position), Yellen is actually the one lying, here.\u00a0 While it is true that commercial lending has expanded, her claim that small business loans have improved is simply false.\u00a0 Even <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-03/one-way-for-trump-to-help-small-business\">Bloomberg begrudgingly acknowledges</a> that small business loans have fallen by at least 6% since the passage of Dodd-Frank.\u00a0 In Obama\u2019s favorite liberal home-base, Chicago, loans to small neighborhood businesses <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/ct-small-business-loans-robert-reed-0205-biz-20170202-column.html\">declined by 49%</a> between 2008 and 2014.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Yellen herself argued that small business loans were in decline because small business owners \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/26/small-biz-lending-tktkt-.html\" target=\"_blank\">don\u2019t want loans anymore.</a>\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 This is a bit like the Bureau of Labor Statistics arguing that over 95 million unemployed working age Americans should not be counted as unemployed in their stats because they really \u201cdon\u2019t want a job.\u201d\u00a0 It is an attempt to muddy the waters on the greater issue, which is that the U.S. economy is in considerable danger.</p>\n<p>You see, I don\u2019t think Trump was debating that major corporations and banks were not receiving ample loans, I think he was primarily pointing out the disparity in small business loans and personal loans.\u00a0 Yellen and the mainstream media attempted to use one data point \u2014 commercial loans, to dismiss the entire debate over loan stagnation.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Fed Is Culpable For Our Bubble Economy And Trying To Shift Blame Before A Collapse</strong></h2>\n<p>The fact is, we all KNOW that major corporations and banks have been flooded with ample loans, and much of this capital was conjured out of thin air by the Fed itself through fiat creation and near zero interest rates.\u00a0 We know this because of the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-buybacks-analysis-idUSKCN0RN0D320150923\" target=\"_blank\">$16 trillion in loans</a> made to companies around the world exposed by the revealing (but limited) TARP audit.\u00a0 We also know this because much of these loans have been used to inflate the stock market bubble for the past few years through <a href=\"http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2013/12/18/feds-low-rates-may-be-juicing-stock-buybacks-at-the-expense-of-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\">endless stock buybacks</a> that most companies never would have been able to afford otherwise. We also know that the mainstream investment world is aware of the importance of these loans because they started to panic as the Fed announced its ongoing program of interest rate hikes.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, we know that the Fed\u2019s low interest loans and culture of circular inbred lending between corporations and banks have been instrumental in keeping stocks hyperinflated, because Fed officials have OPENLY ADMITTED that this is the case.\u00a0 As Richard Fisher of the Dallas Fed stated in an <a href=\"http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000474362\" target=\"_blank\">interview with CNBC</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWhat the Fed did \u2014 and I was part of that group \u2014 is we front-loaded a tremendous market rally, starting in 2009.It\u2019s sort of what I call the \u201creverse Whimpy factor\u201d \u2014 give me two hamburgers today for one tomorrow. I\u2019m not surprised that almost every index you can look at \u2026 was down significantly.\u201d [Referring to the results in the stock market after the Fed raised rates in December 2015.]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u201c\u2026I was warning my colleagues, \u201cDon\u2019t go wobbly if we have a 10-20 percent correction at some point. \u2026 Everybody you talk to \u2026 has been warning that these markets are heavily priced.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>So, again, the issue is not whether or not banks are lending, we know they are lending, they just aren\u2019t lending to the people that need it most.</p>\n<p>I think Fisher was dishonest in his evaluation of the extent of the consequences of the Fed bubble and that a 10% to 20% drop in equities is an absurd underestimation.\u00a0 But setting aside the &#8220;little white lies&#8221;, it is at least widely available knowledge that the Federal Reserve initiated a corporate loan free-for-all, knowing that the supposed benefits were limited in scope as well as in duration.\u00a0 They know that a crash is coming, and they have been stalling until they can find the right scapegoat to divert blame.\u00a0 That scapegoat is Trump, and by association, all conservatives.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px;

all while making conservative movements look like the monster behind the crisis.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the U.S. economy and the dollar are slated for a controlled demolition.\u00a0 The Fed will do everything in its power to prod Trump and conservatives into war with the central bank, because the Fed is now ready to sacrifice itself and the dollar\u2019s world reserve status in order to clear a path for a new global system and ideology. The Federal Reserve is a suicide bomber.</p>\n<p>If this takes place as I predict then the international banks and the establishment elites will be able to lay the blame for the death of king dollar squarely at the feet of Trump and conservatives, and at least a third of the country (leftists) will buy into the narrative lock, stock and barrel because they desperately WANT to believe it.\u00a0 Remember, the tale being scripted here is that Trump is a rampaging maniac that does not know what he is doing.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I am not supporting the continuing dominance of the Fed, or the existence of the fiat dollar.\u00a0 What I am saying is that conservatives may just get what we have been wishing for all these years but not in the manner we had hoped.</p>\n<p>To counter this threat our list of targets must expand to meet reality.\u00a0 The delusion that the core problem is the Federal Reserve must stop.\u00a0 The Fed is a box store, a franchise in a chain of franchises, nothing more.\u00a0 If we do not also turn our scrutiny and aggression towards root globalist institutions like the IMF and the BIS as well as international banks, then our efforts will only serve to bolster the enemy we are trying to fight.</p>\n<p>In a battle limited to Trump versus the Fed, only the bankers will win.</p>\n<p><em>Courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.alt-market.com/articles/3134-in-a-battle-between-trump-and-the-federal-reserve-who-really-wins\" target=\"_blank\">ALT Market</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>If you would like to support the publishing of articles like the one you have just read, visit our donations page <a href=\"http://www.alt-market.com/donate\">here</a>.\u00a0 We greatly appreciate your patronage.</strong></p>\n<p><em>You can contact Brandon Smith at:</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c5e4e5d525853527c5d504811515d4e575948125f5351\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"a6c4d4c7c8c2c9c8e6c7cad28bcbc7d4cdc3d288c5c9cb\">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=\"text/javascript\">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></a></p>\n\n\n<h4><strong>Don't forget to follow the D.C.

I thoroughly debunked their positions and \u201cevidence\u201d by showing how each of their fundamental indicators has actually been in steady decline since 2008, even in the face of massive monetary intervention and fiat printing by the Fed.\n\nMy greatest concern leading up to the 2016 election was that Trump would be allowed to win because he represents the perfect scapegoat for an economic crisis that central banks have been brewing for years. Whether or not Trump is aware of this plan cannot yet be proven, but as I have mentioned in the past, his cabinet of Goldman Sachs alumni and neo-con veterans hardly gives me confidence. In the best case scenario, Trump is surrounded by enemies; in the worst case scenario, he is surrounded by friends.\n\nTrump\u2019s loyalties, though, are a secondary issue for now. The primary focus of this article is to discern whether or not a battle between Trump and the Fed will result in a net positive or a net negative for the public. My position is that any action against the Fed should have happened years ago, and that today, the Fed is nothing more than a sacrificial appendage of a greater globalist agenda. Meaning, conservative groups should be aware that a victory over the Fed is not actually a victory over the globalists. In fact, the globalists may very well WANT a war between the Fed and the White House at this time.\n\nFirst, some facts need to be established to counter the propaganda claims that the Fed is some kind of innocent victim of a rampaging President Trump or \u201cmisguided\u201d conservative rhetoric.\n\nThe Scapegoat Setup Continues\n\nThe latest extension of the Fed\u2019s propaganda has been initiated, of course, by the mainstream media and liberals in general; you know, the same people that were applauding the (in some cases misguided) efforts of the Occupy Wall Street movement. With Trump\u2019s negation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the media has been looking for any opportunity to assert that Trump is either acting to enrich his corporate friends or that he is an idiot man-child when it comes to matters of business and economics.\n\nThis led to some sniping by Elizabeth Warren and Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen\u2018s testimony before congress last week. The argument? That Trump was wrong or \u201clying\u201d when he said that Dodd-Frank had frozen loans from major banks. You can see the glee in media outlets over the stab; a recent article by Vanity Fair, which seemed to focus more on snide ankle biting of Trump than concrete evidence, is a perfect example.\n\nNow, in Trump\u2019s defense (or at least, in defense of his position), Yellen is actually the one lying, here. While it is true that commercial lending has expanded, her claim that small business loans have improved is simply false. Even Bloomberg begrudgingly acknowledges that small business loans have fallen by at least 6% since the passage of Dodd-Frank. In Obama\u2019s favorite liberal home-base, Chicago, loans to small neighborhood businesses declined by 49% between 2008 and 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Yellen herself argued that small business loans were in decline because small business owners \u201cdon\u2019t want loans anymore.\u201d This is a bit like the Bureau of Labor Statistics arguing that over 95 million unemployed working age Americans should not be counted as unemployed in their stats because they really \u201cdon\u2019t want a job.\u201d It is an attempt to muddy the waters on the greater issue, which is that the U.S. economy is in considerable danger.\n\nYou see, I don\u2019t think Trump was debating that major corporations and banks were not receiving ample loans, I think he was primarily pointing out the disparity in small business loans and personal loans. Yellen and the mainstream media attempted to use one data point \u2014 commercial loans, to dismiss the entire debate over loan stagnation.\n\nThe Fed Is Culpable For Our Bubble Economy And Trying To Shift Blame Before A Collapse\n\nThe fact is, we all KNOW that major corporations and banks have been flooded with ample loans, and much of this capital was conjured out of thin air by the Fed itself through fiat creation and near zero interest rates. We know this because of the $16 trillion in loans made to companies around the world exposed by the revealing (but limited) TARP audit. We also know this because much of these loans have been used to inflate the stock market bubble for the past few years through endless stock buybacks that most companies never would have been able to afford otherwise. We also know that the mainstream investment world is aware of the importance of these loans because they started to panic as the Fed announced its ongoing program of interest rate hikes.\n\nBeyond that, we know that the Fed\u2019s low interest loans and culture of circular inbred lending between corporations and banks have been instrumental in keeping stocks hyperinflated, because Fed officials have OPENLY ADMITTED that this is the case. As Richard Fisher of the Dallas Fed stated in an interview with CNBC:\n\n\u201cWhat the Fed did \u2014 and I was part of that group \u2014 is we front-loaded a tremendous market rally, starting in 2009.It\u2019s sort of what I call the \u201creverse Whimpy factor\u201d \u2014 give me two hamburgers today for one tomorrow. I\u2019m not surprised that almost every index you can look at \u2026 was down significantly.\u201d [Referring to the results in the stock market after the Fed raised rates in December 2015.]\n\n\u201c\u2026I was warning my colleagues, \u201cDon\u2019t go wobbly if we have a 10-20 percent correction at some point. \u2026 Everybody you talk to \u2026 has been warning that these markets are heavily priced.\u201d\n\nSo, again, the issue is not whether or not banks are lending, we know they are lending, they just aren\u2019t lending to the people that need it most.\n\nI think Fisher was dishonest in his evaluation of the extent of the consequences of the Fed bubble and that a 10% to 20% drop in equities is an absurd underestimation. But setting aside the \u201clittle white lies\u201d, it is at least widely available knowledge that the Federal Reserve initiated a corporate loan free-for-all, knowing that the supposed benefits were limited in scope as well as in duration. They know that a crash is coming, and they have been stalling until they can find the right scapegoat to divert blame. That scapegoat is Trump, and by association, all conservatives.\n\nAs far as Dodd-Frank is concerned, the act was supposed to be a primer for stopping destructive behavior in the financial sector, more specifically in derivatives. Yet, in spite of Dodd-Frank, banks like Citigroup are STILL bloated with derivatives after receiving at least $476 billion in taxpayer funds to stop them from going bankrupt for the very same irresponsibility.\n\nDodd-Frank accomplished absolutely nothing in terms of what it was mandated to do. I believe the only true purpose of Dodd-Frank was to distract everyone from Ron Paul\u2019s Fed audit bill, which was gaining major traction at the time.\n\nLiberals And The Fed Become Bedfellows?\n\n\n\nSo, why does Trump\u2019s undercutting of Dodd-Frank even matter? As outlined above, it is a propaganda point for the establishment to perpetuate the narrative that Trump is incompetent, that the people who support him are incompetent, and that when the economy does shift into greater crisis it will be his fault and the fault of conservatives. It is also a springboard for the Federal Reserve to \u201cattack\u201d Trump, as shown in Yellen\u2019s congressional testimony.\n\nI also find it interesting that through the Dodd-Frank issue as well as others, leftists are being galvanized in support around the Federal Reserve, something that they probably would not have done a couple of years ago. This is all culminating in what I believe will become a titanic battle not only between Trump and Leftists, but also between Donald Trump and the Fed. But why would the establishment want to incite a conflict between the president and the central bank?\n\nThis is something conservatives and liberty activists have wanted for decades \u2014 a president that would be willing to take on the Federal Reserve and expose its innards. The problem is, the time for the effectiveness of such an action is long gone. Auditing the Fed under Obama (an openly pro-globalist president) would have been a disaster for the powers that be. It would have thrown their entire agenda into disarray and killed any chance that they could complete what they call the \u201cgreat global economic reset.\u201d Auditing or shutting down the Fed under Trump is another matter.\n\nAs I examined in detail with evidence in my article \u2018The Economic End Game Explained\u2019, the Federal Reserve has a shelf life. It has already served its purpose, which was to undermine the American economy and our currency system. The Fed will now begin deflating the bubbles it has engineered in stocks, Treasuries and the dollar through continued interest rate hikes and rolling out the over $4 trillion (official amount) on its balance sheet. The goal? Sinking America and reducing it to third world status over the course of the next several years to make way for total global centralization of economic administration, eventually leading to global fiscal management under the IMF and perhaps the BIS, and a global currency system; all while making conservative movements look like the monster behind the crisis.\n\nTo summarize, the U.S. economy and the dollar are slated for a controlled demolition. The Fed will do everything in its power to prod Trump and conservatives into war with the central bank, because the Fed is now ready to sacrifice itself and the dollar\u2019s world reserve status in order to clear a path for a new global system and ideology. The Federal Reserve is a suicide bomber.\n\nIf this takes place as I predict then the international banks and the establishment elites will be able to lay the blame for the death of king dollar squarely at the feet of Trump and conservatives, and at least a third of the country (leftists) will buy into the narrative lock, stock and barrel because they desperately WANT to believe it. Remember, the tale being scripted here is that Trump is a rampaging maniac that does not know what he is doing.\n\nTo be clear, I am not supporting the continuing dominance of the Fed, or the existence of the fiat dollar. What I am saying is that conservatives may just get what we have been wishing for all these years but not in the manner we had hoped.\n\nTo counter this threat our list of targets must expand to meet reality. The delusion that the core problem is the Federal Reserve must stop. The Fed is a box store, a franchise in a chain of franchises, nothing more. If we do not also turn our scrutiny and aggression towards root globalist institutions like the IMF and the BIS as well as international banks, then our efforts will only serve to bolster the enemy we are trying to fight.\n\nIn a battle limited to Trump versus the Fed, only the bankers will win.\n\nCourtesy of ALT Market\n\nIf you would like to support the publishing of articles like the one you have just read, visit our donations page here.
