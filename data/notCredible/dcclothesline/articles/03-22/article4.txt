jail officials taunted him and accused him of faking his injuries.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the jury returned after deliberating for around 10 hours and found that Williams\u2019 civil rights were violated by both the Tulsa County Sheriff\u2019s Office and former Sheriff Stanley Glanz, who was ordered to pay the family an additional $250,000 in punitive damages from his own pocket.</p>\n<p>The money may come from a \u201cSinking Fund.\u201d The fund is filled with money from property taxes, and local residents can expect an increase in their property taxes if this source is used, reports <a href=\"http://www.fox23.com/news/jury-deliberations-resume-in-jail-death-case/504213729\" target=\"_blank\">Fox 23</a>. While the estate deserves to be compensated for this\u00a0horrific death, shouldn\u2019t the ones who caused it be held financially responsible?</p>\n<p>Williams, an Army veteran, was brought to the jail on October 21, 2011, following an altercation with Owasso police, <a href=\"http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/jury-returns-with-verdict-in-trial-over-elliott-williams-death/article_f16bb091-7caf-5c4d-bd60-ece84a1a615e.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tulsa World</a> reports:</p>\n<blockquote><p>According to testimony and court records, Williams suffered a \u201cmental breakdown\u201d stemming from his separation from his wife and his mother\u2019s cancer diagnosis. Owasso officers pepper-sprayed and arrested the 37-year-old man on an obstruction complaint when he reportedly took a step toward them and said he wanted to be shot.</p>\n<p>Police initially booked Williams into the Owasso Jail but soon transferred him to the county lockup in Tulsa with the expectation that he would receive proper treatment. Rather than undergoing the jail\u2019s screening process or a mental health assessment, however, Williams was placed in a holding cell because he had been \u201cacting up,\u201d Glanz previously testified.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His only alleged crime was a misdemeanor for obstructing an officer, but Williams died in custody before the formal charges could be filed.</p>\n<p>Smolen told jurors Williams had a great smile, a light heart, and passion for preaching, reports <a href=\"https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/jurors-view-video-of-williams-last-hours-in-tulsas-jail/\" target=\"_blank\">The Frontier</a>. Williams wasn\u2019t a career criminal; he had a mental breakdown. He had no felony record, Smolen explained.</p>\n<p>How did Williams break his neck? Multiple theories have been presented, but Sheriff\u2019s Office officials insist that he broke his own neck when he rammed his head into the holding cell door. Williams also <a href=\"https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/jurors-view-video-of-williams-last-hours-in-tulsas-jail/\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> fell 4 feet from a gurney after being arrested.</p>\n<p>The seriously injured man then repeatedly told staff he couldn\u2019t move his legs, and he eventually was taken to the medical unit, even though nurses and detention officers claimed they thought he was faking his condition.</p>\n<p>Former Tulsa County Sheriff\u2019s Office Capt. Billy McKelvey was the first witness to give testimony in the civil trial.</p>\n<p>McKelvey, a former corporal at the Sheriff\u2019s Office internal affairs, investigated Williams\u2019 death.\u00a0His\u00a0March 2012 investigation\u2019s executive summary included a review of photos, witness statements and videos, reports <a href=\"https://www.readfrontier.org/stories/jurors-view-video-of-williams-last-hours-in-tulsas-jail/\" target=\"_blank\">The Frontier</a>.</p>\n<p>His findings are chilling:</p>\n<blockquote><p>McKelvey concluded more than 20 jail and medical staffers came into contact with Williams.</p>\n<p>Williams was picked up from his holding cell, put on a gurney and wheeled to medical where his clothing was \u201cripped\u201d off his body. After that, he was dumped onto his back into a shower and left there for about two hours, McKelvey said his investigation found. Williams repeatedly told detention and medical staff he couldn\u2019t move. When jail staff took Williams from the shower, he was picked up by his arms and legs and dragged to a cell using a blanket.</p>\n<p>No one in the jail called 911 until the very end when Williams was already dead, McKelvey said. He said at the time Williams injured his neck, there was a \u201cpractice\u201d of pointing fingers at the jail\u2019s healthcare provider.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>A testimony in the investigation\u00a0from Christopher Leverich, a detention officer at Tulsa\u2019s jail when Williams died, said he saw Willaims lying in the shower on his stomach screaming \u201chelp me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he find the help he was looking for?\u201d Smolen asked McKelvey.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d McKelvey answered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jail records state that Williams was eating and receiving medical attention, but the surveillance video tells\u00a0a very different story.</p>\n<p>Dan Smolen, an attorney for the Williams estate, told\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.krmg.com/news/local/county-former-sheriff-lose-wrongful-death-lawsuit/0onSKDPa6sZGUBtI2JVJPK/\" target=\"_blank\">KRMG</a>\u00a0the case was unprecedented, in his experience:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s the only case that I\u2019m aware of, not just here locally in Tulsa but really nationally, dealing with people held in a detention setting where the records depict one thing happening, but the reality of what\u2019s truly happening is caught on film over such an extended period of time.</p>\n<p>We believe that this prolonged and reckless neglect, in the way that they treated Elliot Williams in the Tulsa County jail, really constitutes one of the worst civil rights violations in US history.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An autopsy revealed Williams died of complications from the broken neck and severe dehydration.</p>\n<p>During the first day of the trial, jurors saw the last 51 hours of William\u2019s life captured by the jail\u2019s surveillance cameras.</p>\n<p>The graphic video, which was sped up to only last 10 minutes, shows Williams lying motionless on the floor while detention and medical staff walk by, ignoring his cries for help.

The detective was not arrested and numerous VA police officers stated the veteran fall off a chair and struck his head on the floor. The VA Detective at a MSPB hearing threatened to kill three nurses who were witnesses. The VA Chief of Police investigated the matter and determined the veteran CARLOS COLON was only slapped. THe VA Chief of Police was a GSA contract security supervisor who called veterans bums and abused them at the NYC VA Regional Office. VA officials told VA Police that the new Chief was a retired NYPD Precinct Commander and Chief, Special Operations. He was neither. The Chief hired his brother in law to be a VA cop and he assaulted a female VA Sgt. Rachel Taylor. Sgt. Taylor was a disabled veteran. She was demoted and the offender was promoted. Poisonings of several veterans was covered up by VA officials. I could go on all day long. A Nassau County Corrections Officer named Gately goes to Central America has sex with boys and girls and was arrested by ICE bringing marijuana into JFK. Gately had a video showing him screwing a boy. Customs handled the video but did not play it. Gately played the video in jail and the other corrections officers and inmates just laugh. All these officials in this case should be arrested from the Chief to officers, to nursing staff. To let a veteran or anyone go without medical care is gross negligance. I&#8217;ve been to Congressmen, Senators and VA officials, NCPD and ICE. No one really cares or wants to arrest law enforcement unless there&#8217;s hundreds of witnesses. The system is sick.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"dsq-comment-24496\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-24496\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-24496\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-24496\">Silence DoGood</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-24496\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-24496\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>While this is sad, disgusting, and reprehensible that someone who served our country could be treated this way, and while the money awarded can provide some benefit for their loss &#8211; it does not replace his life or give it back.

jail officials taunted him and accused him of faking his injuries.\n\nOn Monday, the jury returned after deliberating for around 10 hours and found that Williams\u2019 civil rights were violated by both the Tulsa County Sheriff\u2019s Office and former Sheriff Stanley Glanz, who was ordered to pay the family an additional $250,000 in punitive damages from his own pocket.\n\nThe money may come from a \u201cSinking Fund.\u201d The fund is filled with money from property taxes, and local residents can expect an increase in their property taxes if this source is used, reports Fox 23. While the estate deserves to be compensated for this horrific death, shouldn\u2019t the ones who caused it be held financially responsible?\n\nWilliams, an Army veteran, was brought to the jail on October 21, 2011, following an altercation with Owasso police, Tulsa World reports:\n\nAccording to testimony and court records, Williams suffered a \u201cmental breakdown\u201d stemming from his separation from his wife and his mother\u2019s cancer diagnosis. Owasso officers pepper-sprayed and arrested the 37-year-old man on an obstruction complaint when he reportedly took a step toward them and said he wanted to be shot. Police initially booked Williams into the Owasso Jail but soon transferred him to the county lockup in Tulsa with the expectation that he would receive proper treatment. Rather than undergoing the jail\u2019s screening process or a mental health assessment, however, Williams was placed in a holding cell because he had been \u201cacting up,\u201d Glanz previously testified.\n\nHis only alleged crime was a misdemeanor for obstructing an officer, but Williams died in custody before the formal charges could be filed.\n\nSmolen told jurors Williams had a great smile, a light heart, and passion for preaching, reports The Frontier. Williams wasn\u2019t a career criminal; he had a mental breakdown. He had no felony record, Smolen explained.\n\nHow did Williams break his neck? Multiple theories have been presented, but Sheriff\u2019s Office officials insist that he broke his own neck when he rammed his head into the holding cell door. Williams also reportedly fell 4 feet from a gurney after being arrested.\n\nThe seriously injured man then repeatedly told staff he couldn\u2019t move his legs, and he eventually was taken to the medical unit, even though nurses and detention officers claimed they thought he was faking his condition.\n\nFormer Tulsa County Sheriff\u2019s Office Capt. Billy McKelvey was the first witness to give testimony in the civil trial.\n\nMcKelvey, a former corporal at the Sheriff\u2019s Office internal affairs, investigated Williams\u2019 death. His March 2012 investigation\u2019s executive summary included a review of photos, witness statements and videos, reports The Frontier.\n\nHis findings are chilling:\n\nMcKelvey concluded more than 20 jail and medical staffers came into contact with Williams. Williams was picked up from his holding cell, put on a gurney and wheeled to medical where his clothing was \u201cripped\u201d off his body. After that, he was dumped onto his back into a shower and left there for about two hours, McKelvey said his investigation found. Williams repeatedly told detention and medical staff he couldn\u2019t move. When jail staff took Williams from the shower, he was picked up by his arms and legs and dragged to a cell using a blanket. No one in the jail called 911 until the very end when Williams was already dead, McKelvey said. He said at the time Williams injured his neck, there was a \u201cpractice\u201d of pointing fingers at the jail\u2019s healthcare provider. A testimony in the investigation from Christopher Leverich, a detention officer at Tulsa\u2019s jail when Williams died, said he saw Willaims lying in the shower on his stomach screaming \u201chelp me.\u201d \u201cDid he find the help he was looking for?\u201d Smolen asked McKelvey. \u201cNo,\u201d McKelvey answered.\n\nJail records state that Williams was eating and receiving medical attention, but the surveillance video tells a very different story.\n\nDan Smolen, an attorney for the Williams estate, told KRMG the case was unprecedented, in his experience:\n\nIt\u2019s the only case that I\u2019m aware of, not just here locally in Tulsa but really nationally, dealing with people held in a detention setting where the records depict one thing happening, but the reality of what\u2019s truly happening is caught on film over such an extended period of time. We believe that this prolonged and reckless neglect, in the way that they treated Elliot Williams in the Tulsa County jail, really constitutes one of the worst civil rights violations in US history.\n\nAn autopsy revealed Williams died of complications from the broken neck and severe dehydration.\n\nDuring the first day of the trial, jurors saw the last 51 hours of William\u2019s life captured by the jail\u2019s surveillance cameras.\n\nThe graphic video, which was sped up to only last 10 minutes, shows Williams lying motionless on the floor while detention and medical staff walk by, ignoring his cries for help. Guards throw food into his cell and place water just out of his reach.\n\nWarning: Disturbing content\n\nWilliams\u2019s estate sought $51 million in compensatory damages from Glanz and the Tulsa County Sheriff\u2019s Office, who were accused of being deliberately indifferent to Williams\u2019 medical needs.\n\nIn explaining their rationale for the amount requested, attorneys said they wanted $1 million for every hour Williams lay paralyzed and covered in his own excrement in the cell where he died.\n\nAn autopsy report found that Williams died from complications of a broken neck and exhibited signs of dehydration.\n\nSmolen said the verdict should serve as a wake-up call for the Tulsa County Sheriff\u2019s Office and its former sheriff.\n\n\u201cI just hope that the county takes it seriously and they do something,\u201d Smolen told Tulsa World.\n\nKevin Williams, Elliott\u2019s brother, said he was satisfied with the jury\u2019s decision, but he called for criminal charges to be filed.\n\n\u201cNo amount of money is going to bring him back. People need to be going to jail. There needs to be criminal charges filed,\u201d Williams said.\n\nLily Dane is a staff writer for The Daily Sheeple.
