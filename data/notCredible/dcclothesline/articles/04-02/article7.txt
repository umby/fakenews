The reason this is an epidemic is not hard to figure out.  First, the vast majority of these kids have little or no parental guidance or supervision.  But much more than that, they are bombarded with ads for the latest cell phones, big screen TVs, vacations, computers, clothes, gadgets and the list goes on, none of which they can possibly afford. They want money to woo girls on dates or even pay for prostitutes. Worse, the prospect of these kids finding anything but a minimum wage job, now or in the future is slim to none.  Most kids have active imaginations and will concoct ways of getting what they want, by any means.  The true number of kids who are dealing drugs to get what they think they must have is off the charts.  This country is in so much trouble, with tens of millions of illiterate kids dropping out of school or being graduated while they have no command of the English language and can&#8217;t perform four function arithmetic. Welcome to the next generation of criminals who are already roaming the streets like pack animals.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-25465\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-25465\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-25465\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-25465\">John Gould</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-25465\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-25465\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Thank you for your post.

I started working in my family&#8217;s radio and TV broadcasting business when I was 12.  I was also a consumer of the daily news and the Wall Street Journal at that early age, which was a fraction of what we are besieged with today.  Only people like us can compare society today with what it was like to live in this country in the 50&#8217;s, 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s.  Life was easy and for the most part fun. Until I started working, I was extremely bored.   Without computers and the internet, it took serious work to get anything done.  I tell kids today, imagine having to go to the public library to research anything, but what you could look up in a dictionary or an encyclopedia.  They just look at your with total disbelief.  And there were three TV channels.  Most say they would have gone completely nuts in that environment.  I live in Las Vegas about 5 miles from the strip.  When I moved here 12 years ago, this was a completely different place.  I walked for miles in the evening in the cool desert nights.  Now, when the sun goes down, it is no longer safe to walk anywhere.  I have been held up by thugs at gunpoint twice on the street just two blocks from my house.  So I drive to major casinos to walk.  I cannot imagine what life in America will be like in a few more years.  I seriously doubt that government at any level will ever have the resources to bring law and order back to this country that we enjoyed in the 20th century.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-4\" id=\"dsq-comment-25486\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-25486\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-25486\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-25486\">Ann Tenna</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-25486\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-25486\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Photographic memory huh?..</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\" id=\"dsq-comment-25496\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-25496\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-25496\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-25496\">Blankety-Blank</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-25496\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-25496\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>I used to be as young as you. Quite a while ago. And I mostly agree with you. Except when it comes to drugs. There is little prospect of good jobs becoming available in this country. The decline has been occurring for decades, but most people don&#8217;t pay attention. Simple evidence: when I was young, a father could support his entire family on his blue-collar wages, own a house, car, take vacations, all the norms. Now two parents working their asses off can&#8217;t make it.<br />\nBut as to drugs. We learned during Prohibition that such regulations are counterproductive, rewarding the least moral, most vicious people while corrupting entire municipal organizations and police departments. So why are repeating that mistake? Nixon started it. Then look to all the other lying, thieving, bastard politicians who can be bribed with a little drug money to continue the charade of &#8220;vital protection of our society&#8221;. Thanks a bunch, greedy, idiot politicians.<br />\nMeantime, as you say, our schools are deplorable and getting worse. For graduate school, we import people from other countries who then proceed to take many of the best jobs we offer. Nothing wrong with immigration &#8211; that&#8217;s how we all got here. But how about taking care of our own population first? I think all our politicians should be shot when elected. Things would probably be better without them, and given how horribly most of them have performed, this wouldn&#8217;t be any less deserved than what happened to the kids who broke into this house.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment even depth-3\" id=\"dsq-comment-25500\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-25500\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-25500\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-25500\">VegasLane</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-25500\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-25500\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>Prohibition was about alcohol, not drugs.  As yes, that was totally ridiculous.  Can you imagine what things would be like today if there were no criminal laws on the books for hard core street drugs?  Where pot has been legalized, grade school kids are showing up at school with that crap.  Canibus dispensaries are barely getting off the ground here in Nevada, which is supposed to require a permit issued by a doctor as to the medical necessity before anyone can make a purchase.  Travel agencies are opening to run tours of pot shops to our 42 million tourists.  Yesterday they announced bars where patrons can openly smoke pot.  I know too many people who started with pot then moved on to either RX drugs or street drugs, sometimes both.  So I consider pot a gateway drug.  Having owned a psychiatric hospital and attending the medical board meetings for over a decade, that was the universal opinion of our psychiatrists.  Last night I watched Drugs, Inc. on the National Geographic Channel.  The episode was filmed in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.  Nat Geo followed drug salesman who were selling dangerous knock off street drugs that can kill when combined with other drugs or alcohol.  There are cocaine addicts who are able to function in white collar jobs, but who invariably steal to support their habit.  This is one more major problem that could easily top $1 trillion in total costs without ever rehabbing the addicts considering that 90% go back to the drug after exiting rehab.  The bottom line is that the vast majority of people who are hooked on drugs are self medicating to escape reality and treat their overwhelming depression.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    <ul class=\"children\">\n    <li class=\"comment odd alt depth-4\" id=\"dsq-comment-25544\">\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-header-25544\" class=\"dsq-comment-header\">\n            <cite id=\"dsq-cite-25544\">\n                <span id=\"dsq-author-user-25544\">Blankety-Blank</span>\n            </cite>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"dsq-comment-body-25544\" class=\"dsq-comment-body\">\n            <div id=\"dsq-comment-message-25544\" class=\"dsq-comment-message\"><p>During Prohibition, more alcohol was consumed per capita than at any time before or since, until recently when the drinking age was raised and it became fashionable to act illegally again. Drugs would have been the same. Raise the incentives, and the use skyrockets. Remove the incentives to drug use, and it plummets. You know people who start with pot and move on? Very powerful flawed analogy. Every single drug addict started with milk, the original gateway to physical satisfaction. So let&#8217;s ban milk and eliminate drug addiction.<br />\nDo you have any idea why psychiatrists become psychiatrists? To solve their OWN problems. Fifty percent of what doctors know is wrong. Trouble is, nobody knows which fifty percent that is. I would distrust anyone&#8217;s judgment when their opinion leads to higher income. Of course the docs insist that gateway drugs are a problem. No evidence that it&#8217;s true, but conventional wisdom, often wrong, is hardly ever doubted. Of course coke addicts steal. That&#8217;s because making drugs illegal drives the price out of sight. Make them cheap and easily accessible and the related crime disappears. Even the drug lords will have to look elsewhere for work.<br />\nThe Russians self-medicate for depression with vodak. At least they only cause traffic accidents, not international drug wars. Even if druggies are self-medicating &#8211; and that has yet to be demonstrated, if it has any basis at all in fact &#8211; treating depression conventionally hasn&#8217;t been all that effective, but it&#8217;s a damned sight better for individuals and society than making illegal those actions which harm nobody but the self-indulgent. Booze, drugs, or even sex &#8211; the government should just leave them alone and life would get a lot easier for everyone. Except the drug lords and corrupt cops might have to find honest work.</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ul><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n            </ul>\n\n\n        </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar disqus_url = 'http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/04/02/family-of-dead-teen-burglar-claims-it-wasnt-fair-that-their-kid-brought-brass-knuckles-to-a-ar-15-fight/';\nvar disqus_identifier = '71159 http://www.dcclothesline.com/?p=71159';\nvar disqus_container_id = 'disqus_thread';\nvar disqus_shortname = 'dcclothesline';\nvar disqus_title = \"Family of Dead Teen Burglar Claims it wasn&#8217;t Fair that their Kid brought Brass Knuckles to a AR-15 Fight\";\nvar disqus_config_custom = window.disqus_config;\nvar disqus_config = function () {\n    /*\n    All currently supported events:\n    onReady: fires when everything is ready,\n    onNewComment: fires when a new comment is posted,\n    onIdentify: fires when user is authenticated\n    */\n    \n    \n    this.language = '';\n        this.callbacks.onReady.push(function () {\n\n        // sync comments in the background so we don't block the page\n        var script = document.createElement('script');\n        script.async = true;\n        script.src = '?cf_action=sync_comments&post_id=71159';\n\n        var firstScript = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n        firstScript.parentNode.insertBefore(script, firstScript);\n    });\n    \n    if (disqus_config_custom) {\n        disqus_config_custom.call(this);\n    }\n};\n\n(function() {\n    var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript';\n    dsq.async = true;\n    dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';\n    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);\n})();\n</script>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</div><!-- #content -->\n\t\t</div><!-- #container -->\n\n\n\t\t<div id=\"primary\" class=\"widget-area\" role=\"complementary\">\n\t\t\t<ul class=\"xoxo\">\n\n<li id=\"blog_subscription-3\" class=\"widget-container jetpack_subscription_widget\"><h3 class=\"widget-title\">Subscribe TODAY and Never Miss Another D.C.

They were armed with a knife and brass knuckles, but he was armed with an AR-15 and shot and killed all three teens. Now, the family is crying about how unfair it was that the man defended himself and his father with an AR-15 against three teenage thugs.\n\nFrom the earlier report:\n\nAccording to Wagoner County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the homeowner and his son were inside the home when the teens broke in. The teens, ages 16, 17, and 18, were wearing masks and gloves . One of the teens had a knife and another had brass knuckles , according to Deputy Nick Mahoney. \u201cThese three individuals came to this residence with the intent to burglarize it,\u201d Mahoney said, \u201cOne was with brass knuckles, the other one was with a knife.\u201d The son of the homeowner was sleeping when he was awakened by \u201cloud bangs\u201d coming from the back door around 12:30pm on Monday. The 23-year-old man armed himself with his semi-automatic AR-15 rifle and made his way towards the back door where he confronted the three burglars. \u201cThere was a short exchange of words, then gunfire happened,\u201d Mahoney said. \u201cArmed with a rifle, there were some shots fired, and, at this point, three people are deceased.\u201d\n\nLeroy Schumacher, grandfather of 17-year-old Jacob Redfearn who was shot and killed along with two other teens who were committing the crime, claims it was not fair that his boy was only armed with brass knuckles while the homeowner\u2019s son who shot him was armed with an Ar-15.\n\n\u201cWhat these three boys did was stupid,\u201d said Leroy Schumacher. \u201cThey knew they could be punished for it but they did not deserve to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrass knuckles against an AR-15, come on, who was afraid for their life,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a limit to that law, I mean he shot all three of them; there was no need for that.\u201d\n\nRedfearn was shot and killed along with 19-year-old Maxwell Cook and 16-year-old Jake Woodruff.\n\nThe problem that Schumacher can\u2019t seem to face is that he claims his grandson had never been in trouble, but how does he know that? Was this just the first time that they got caught? After all, in the previous report, I mentioned that neighbors said there have been multiple burglaries in their neighborhood over the past few weeks and months.\n\nSecond, why would someone in the family not teach young Redfearn the Scriptures pertaining to such criminal activity?\n\nMy son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them. If they say, \u201cCome along with us; let\u2019s lie in wait for innocent blood, let\u2019s ambush some harmless soul; let\u2019s swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder; cast lots with us; we will all share the loot\u201d\u2014 my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths; for their feet rush into evil, they are swift to shed blood. How useless to spread a net where every bird can see it! These men lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush only themselves! Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the life of those who get it. -Proverbs 1:10-19\n\nDeputies believe the man who shot them was acting in self-defense.\n\nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost\n\nTim Brown is an author and Editor at FreedomOutpost.com, SonsOfLibertyMedia.com, GunsInTheNews.com and TheWashingtonStandard.com.
