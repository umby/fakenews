href=\"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/09/29/only-on-2-o-c-woman-says-airline-gave-her-pre-booked-seat-away-because-2-men-didnt-want-to-sit-next-to-female/\"><em><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">CBS2 Los Angeles</span></em></a> that <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Mary Campos</span></strong> \u2014 an Orange County mom, a million-mile flier, and a senior consultant in the oil and gas industry \u2014 said United Airlines discriminated against her by changing her pre-assigned seat because two Muslim men refused to sit next to a female.</p>\n<p>On September 26, 2016, just before Campos got on her pre-booked flight to Houston, a gate agent handed her a new boarding pass, saying, \u201cThis is your new seat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Campos said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d.</p>\n<p>The agent said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this. The two gentlemen seated next to you have cultural beliefs that prevent them from sitting next to, or talking to or communicating with females.\u201d</p>\n<p>Campos was shocked. She told CBS LA: \u201cI thought I lived in a culture [America] where women were equal to men. We can\u2019t discriminate against half the population for a belief from another nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Campos was told the two men in long orange shirts were Pakistani \u201cmonks\u201d and that the female UA flight crew were not allowed to serve the men.</p>\n<p>Campos said she had no choice but to take her new seat assignment. Then she wrote a letter to the CEO of United Airlines, which said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhat if I were handicapped, or transgender? What if your entire crew were female? Any belief that prevents individuals from interacting with females should not travel on commercial aircraft.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>She got a reply that said United would look into it, but she didn\u2019t hear from them again.</p>\n<p>CBS2 made inquiries and received this communication from UA spokesman Jonathan Guerin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe regret that Ms. Campos was unhappy with the handling of the seat assignments on her flight. United holds its employees to the highest standards of professionalism and has zero tolerance for discrimination.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Campos said she wants two things from United:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Apologize to every female who was on that plane, including United Airlines\u2019 employees.</li>\n<li>Change their policy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If UA is not forthcoming, Campos said she would do whatever she had to do to protect women\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIf_1KxiyUg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;start=67&amp;wmode=transparent\" width=\"500\" height=\"312\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>On October 11, 2017, Orange County supervisors announced it will not award additional flights for next year to United Airlines or any airlines at John Wayne Airport until they promise to follow federal laws that prohibit gender, race and age discrimination.</p>\n<p><strong>Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Lisa Bartlett</strong> asked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhat would happen if you had an all-female flight attendant crew? What if there were female pilots and co-pilots? This goes way beyond discrimination of passengers. We\u2019re talking about personnel on the flights.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Supervisor Todd Spitzer</strong> said he and the other supervisors \u201cwere very offended\u201d when they found out about Mary Campos being reassigned her seat because she\u2019s a woman \u201clike Rosa Parks was during the civil rights movement.\u201d Spitzer said he had asked United to attend the supervisor meeting on October 11. Instead, the airline issued another canned statement:</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe regret that our handling of the seat assignments has caused concern. We have zero tolerance for discrimination against any protected characteristics including gender. We have reached out to Ms. Campos to discuss her concerns. Our goal is to provide safe and comfortable travel for all of our customers and we regret that Ms. Campos was unhappy with the handling of the seat assignments on her flight. United holds our employees to the highest standards of professionalism and has zero tolerance for discrimination.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>\n<p>Campos told CBS2 she applauded the Orange County Board of Supervisor for making a stance that \u201call airports need to take to make sure that airlines are enforcing the same kind of policy.\u201d But she said United still had not reached out to her to apologize; neither had UA said anything about changing its policy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe toughest part is that to date, United still hasn\u2019t had anything more than canned responses. I\u2019m not going to let it go because our daughters and other females deserve that.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The county\u2019s contracts with airlines do ban discrimination, but do not include all of the classes of people covered by federal law. So Supervisor Michelle Steel moved to include all of the federal law\u2019s protected classes, including women, in the county\u2019s contracts.</p>\n<p>At its Oct. 25 meeting, the board would get an update on renegotiated contracts and consider passenger load allocations for the airlines.</p>\n<p>I searched on the Internet for follow-up news on this incident, but found nothing.</p>\n<p>Not a word from the National Organization for Women (NOW).</p>\n<p>I did find that on March 10, 2017, an Illinois <a href=\"http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/03/10/muslim-family-says-united-airlines-discriminated-against-them/\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Muslim family filed a lawsuit</span></a> against United Airlines alleging discrimination after they were escorted off a flight from Chicago to Washington D.C. The airline eventually booked them on another flight the same day.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Mohamad and Eaman Shebley</span></strong>\u2018s lawyer Phil Robertson claims that airline staff humiliated and disrespected the Shebleys \u201cwith hostility and arbitrary and unreasonable reactions\u201d when they inquired about one of their kids using a booster seat.

It was already getting unenjoyable before 9/11. Now as far as I am concerned it is downright terrible.  No enjoyment to it at all.  Still the airlines (and the TSA) owe us the American taxpayer the effort to try to make it possible to enjoy. But as far as I can see nobody is doing that. Just piling restrictions on top of restrictions, and the PASSENGER is always at fault. No thanks. If I could afford my own airplane I might fly, but otherwise if I can&#8217;t drive there and spend the time doing it I don&#8217;t go.

In the United States, there is not supposed to be special treatment for anyone. When venture to the United States, they should be aware that they are not in their own Muslim countries where their culture is distinct from what we practice in the U.S.  Therefore, ALL companies, especially our American Airlines, when addressing individuals from Muslim Countries, need to inform these potential customers, that they will forced to sit besides women and other occupants that Muslims view with distaste, in holding to their Koranic beliefs.  As I have imparted in the past, it is time to get rid of the Koran, for without the Koran as a Musim&#8217;s crutch, Muslims are helpless.  Before Muslims travel to the States, they should be made aware that the United States does not abide by the rules of the Muslim CULT.  This is an objective theme that perhaps our 45th POTUS is required to address, similar to how he addressed the banning of Muslims from these 6 Muslim nations from entering our country.  In addition, I have yet to discover why our 45th POTUS was permitted to cave, to the demands of these circuit courts, when<br />\nour 45th POTUS maintains the sole authority to admit or deter anyone from entering<br />\nour country.

The two gentlemen seated next to you have cultural beliefs that prevent them from sitting next to, or talking to or communicating with females.\u201d\n\nCampos was shocked. She told CBS LA: \u201cI thought I lived in a culture [America] where women were equal to men. We can\u2019t discriminate against half the population for a belief from another nation.\u201d\n\nCampos was told the two men in long orange shirts were Pakistani \u201cmonks\u201d and that the female UA flight crew were not allowed to serve the men.\n\nCampos said she had no choice but to take her new seat assignment. Then she wrote a letter to the CEO of United Airlines, which said, in part:\n\n\u201cWhat if I were handicapped, or transgender? What if your entire crew were female? Any belief that prevents individuals from interacting with females should not travel on commercial aircraft.\u201d\n\nShe got a reply that said United would look into it, but she didn\u2019t hear from them again.\n\nCBS2 made inquiries and received this communication from UA spokesman Jonathan Guerin:\n\n\u201cWe regret that Ms. Campos was unhappy with the handling of the seat assignments on her flight. United holds its employees to the highest standards of professionalism and has zero tolerance for discrimination.\u201d\n\nCampos said she wants two things from United:\n\nApologize to every female who was on that plane, including United Airlines\u2019 employees. Change their policy.\n\nIf UA is not forthcoming, Campos said she would do whatever she had to do to protect women\u2019s rights.\n\nOn October 11, 2017, Orange County supervisors announced it will not award additional flights for next year to United Airlines or any airlines at John Wayne Airport until they promise to follow federal laws that prohibit gender, race and age discrimination.\n\nOrange County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Lisa Bartlett asked:\n\n\u201cWhat would happen if you had an all-female flight attendant crew? What if there were female pilots and co-pilots? This goes way beyond discrimination of passengers. We\u2019re talking about personnel on the flights.\u201d\n\nSupervisor Todd Spitzer said he and the other supervisors \u201cwere very offended\u201d when they found out about Mary Campos being reassigned her seat because she\u2019s a woman \u201clike Rosa Parks was during the civil rights movement.\u201d Spitzer said he had asked United to attend the supervisor meeting on October 11. Instead, the airline issued another canned statement:\n\n\u201cWe regret that our handling of the seat assignments has caused concern. We have zero tolerance for discrimination against any protected characteristics including gender. We have reached out to Ms. Campos to discuss her concerns. Our goal is to provide safe and comfortable travel for all of our customers and we regret that Ms. Campos was unhappy with the handling of the seat assignments on her flight. United holds our employees to the highest standards of professionalism and has zero tolerance for discrimination.\u201d\n\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\nCampos told CBS2 she applauded the Orange County Board of Supervisor for making a stance that \u201call airports need to take to make sure that airlines are enforcing the same kind of policy.\u201d But she said United still had not reached out to her to apologize; neither had UA said anything about changing its policy:\n\n\u201cThe toughest part is that to date, United still hasn\u2019t had anything more than canned responses. I\u2019m not going to let it go because our daughters and other females deserve that.\u201d\n\nThe county\u2019s contracts with airlines do ban discrimination, but do not include all of the classes of people covered by federal law. So Supervisor Michelle Steel moved to include all of the federal law\u2019s protected classes, including women, in the county\u2019s contracts.\n\nAt its Oct. 25 meeting, the board would get an update on renegotiated contracts and consider passenger load allocations for the airlines.\n\nI searched on the Internet for follow-up news on this incident, but found nothing.\n\nNot a word from the National Organization for Women (NOW).\n\nI did find that on March 10, 2017, an Illinois Muslim family filed a lawsuit against United Airlines alleging discrimination after they were escorted off a flight from Chicago to Washington D.C. The airline eventually booked them on another flight the same day.\n\nMohamad and Eaman Shebley\u2018s lawyer Phil Robertson claims that airline staff humiliated and disrespected the Shebleys \u201cwith hostility and arbitrary and unreasonable reactions\u201d when they inquired about one of their kids using a booster seat. Another Shebley lawyer Maaria Mozaffar said the family wants some measure of justice in the form of \u201ccompensation\u201d and a change in UA policies regarding how \u201cminority\u201d passengers are treated.\n\nTherein lies at least one explanation for why businesses bend over to appease Muslims: Muslims have learned to exploit the system and are aggressive in pursuit of their interests, whether via lawsuits or violence.\n\nWe are in a war of civilizations, but most of us are blind and oblivious.\n\nAmerican non-Muslims, including Christians, must fight back by asserting ourselves. Mary Campos should have sued United Airlines because lawsuits seem to be the only language UA and other businesses understand.\n\nIf we don\u2019t fight back, we\u2019ll become another Sweden where their cucked men advertise their surrender with pink pussyhats.
