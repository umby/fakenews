In the tragic comedy of denial that every Islamic terrorism investigation inevitably becomes, the authorities are still hunting around for his motive.</p>\n<p>The media claims that her Muslim killer, like every other Muslim terrorist in the past two years, was mentally unstable. According to official reports, he was incoherent. According to other accounts, he told the police that he had followed the commands of the Koran. He certainly would not have been the first.</p>\n<p>The street where Sarah Lucy\u2019s broken body lay was the Rue de Vaucouleurs. It\u2019s close to Belleville, a neighborhood whose name means \u201cBeautiful town\u201d, but which is better known these days as one of France\u2019s &#8220;Zones Urbaines Sensibles&#8221; or \u201cSensitive Urban Zones.\u201d</p>\n<p>Or, without the euphemisms, parts of the beautiful town are really a \u201cNo Go Zone\u201d. Or, if you prefer the official descriptions, a vibrant, colorful and multicultural community full of delightfully exotic foods.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, smirking media reporters had a field day visiting Belleville to show that FOX News reports about No Go Zones in France were nonsense. \u201cLook, at the couscous restaurants and colorful scarves, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unless your delightfully multicultural Muslim neighbor decides to shove you through a window while shouting one of his religion\u2019s exotic genocidal epithets about the Jews and all infidels.</p>\n<p>Belleville was once home to many Jews. Then Jews from North Africa fled there after Muslim takeovers deprived them of the civil rights they had briefly enjoyed under French rule. And their Mohammedan oppressors followed. Some years back, the JTA ran one of its cheerful Islamophilic pieces about Belleville. &#8220;In one Paris neighborhood, Jews and Muslims live as they did in North Africa.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That is indeed true. Just not in the way that the JTA would like its gullible readers to believe.</p>\n<p>Yonathan Halimi, Sarah Lucy\u2019s son, describes the killer\u2019s family as being known for its anti-Semitism. &#8220;One day, one of the killer&#8217;s sisters pushed my sister down the stairs, and the next time she called her a dirty Jew,&#8221; he described. Sarah\u2019s brother said that the killer called Sarah and her daughter, \u201cdirty Jews\u201d.</p>\n<p>This is how Jews and Muslims lived in North Africa. This is how they lived everywhere under Muslim rule. Now this is how Jews and Muslims live in Paris and anywhere else settled by Islamic migration.</p>\n<p>Halimi is a common last name among North African Jews. It means that their ancestors once lived in Ksar Oulad Abd El Halim in Morocco. You can still find Stars of David on the buildings in Ksar Oulad Abd El Halim, but the Jews are all gone. There are Halimis in Paris. But not as many as there once were.</p>\n<p>A decade ago, Ilan Halimi was captured and tortured to death by monsters who styled themselves the \u201cGang of Barbarians\u201d. The barbarians left him dying by the side of the road with burns and stab wounds over most of his body while the police did their best to direct attention away from the inconvenient question of Muslim anti-Semitism. Since then the head of the Gang of Barbarians has managed to produce videos from jail in which he spews hatred at Jews and promotes Islamic terrorism.</p>\n<p>On the day before Passover Eve, a thousand Jews gathered outside the building where the latest Halimi was murdered. As they memorialized Sarah Lucy Halimi, the colorful and multicultural settlers of this portion of occupied Paris, greeted them with thrown bottles and shouts of, \u201cDirty Jews\u201d.</p>\n<p>The same taunt aimed at the Halimis by the Muslim killer and his occupying clan. Truly, Jews and Muslims live in Paris as they did in North Africa.</p>\n<p>But the media always has its own spin on the Muslim murder of non-Muslims. As Le Figaro\u2019s account put it, the demonstrators \u201cdispersed\u201d after an \u201caltercation\u201d with the \u201cyoung people of the neighborhood\u201d.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>The Jews, even though they lived here before the Islamic invasion arrived, are never the people of the neighborhood. Sarah Lucy Halimi had lived in her building for three decades. The Muslim family of her killer arrived at a later date and yet she remained an outsider to be murdered while Muslim violence and hatred is referred to only through euphemisms such as \u201cyouths of the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the marchers sang the French National Anthem in this terrible place, while an invading army of \u201cyouths\u201d watched, jeered and hooted from the windows, some of its lines had an ominous resonance.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgainst us tyranny&#8217;s Bloody banner is raised.\u201d And indeed, the black flags of Islam can be seen flying in France\u2019s No Go Zones. \u201cThey are coming right into your arms. To cut the throats of your sons, your women!\u201d They are coming. And we take them in. We feed them, we clothe them and then they kill us.</p>\n<p>But there was also the rising chorus of Hatikvah. Sarah Lucy Halimi, like her son, like so many other Halimis, has found her final home in Israel. Before the arrival of Passover, she made her own exodus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An eternal flame will burn on the altar, it will not be extinguished,&#8221; her son eulogized her with a quote from the Bible at her burial in Jerusalem. &#8220;I can testify that she contained an eternal flame.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That is where the religion of Sarah Lucy Halimi differs so fundamentally from that of her killer. And where her God differs so fundamentally from Allah.</p>\n<p>The Kaddish prayer for the dead that they recited both at the march and at her funeral has its similarities to Islam\u2019s Allahu Akbar with its ringing declaration, \u201cGlorified and sanctified be God\u2019s great name.\u201d But where Muslims declare the greatness of their deity when murdering Jews, Jews praise God when memorializing the victims of Islamic oppression because unlike Muslims they see death not as a gateway to an obscene orgy of carnal pleasures, but as the expression of the eternal flame of the soul.</p>\n<p>The Muslim killer\u2019s shout of Allahu Akbar, his declaration of his deity\u2019s greatness at empowering him to throw a 66-year-old nursery school director out of a window, is really an indictment of Islam.</p>\n<p>The first ever cry of \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d was uttered during Mohammed\u2019s massacre of the Jews of Khaibar. The murderous bandit who founded Islam had lain in wait for the Jews who cultivated palm trees in a desert oasis to emerge in the morning. When the Jews came out with spades to make the desert bloom, Muslims attacked the gardeners with weapons against which gardening tools are no match.</p>\n<p>Mohammed shouted, \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d. That does not mean, as the phrase is often mistranslated, that Allah is great. Or as it is even more woefully mistranslated, God is great. For Allah is only the deity of Islam. Instead Mohammed shouted that his god was greater than the God of the Jews because Allah had enabled him to ambush unarmed men. Or to throw a 66-year-old nursery director out of a window.</p>\n<p>\u201cKhaybar Khaybar, ya yahud,\u201d remains a popular racist Muslim chant. Jews, remember Khaybar.</p>\n<p>Khaybar is worth remembering as is an elderly woman falling from the third floor to 30 Rue de Vaucouleurs, and every atrocity and act of racist Islamic terror in the 1,389 years in between.</p>\n<p>A war against humanity is underway. It began long ago. The killers shout, \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d. And their victims fall from New York City skyscrapers and third floor Parisian apartments.

But what are the innocent Muslim children taught and which is read five times a day? They are taught EXACTLY to do what this miserable assassin did to this innocent lady &#8211; murder and hate, not just for Jews, but for anyone and anything which is not Islamic. And what do we, who see this mayhem going on at an increasingly terrifying rate &#8211; NOTHING &#8211; simply NOTHING, except to allow them to stand in OUR elections,p both local and national, even though their &#8216;principles&#8217; are directly and permanently the opposite of that which we hold dear. What madness this is &#8211; and little wonder that they are increasingly emboldened by our PC madness &#8211; usually perpetrated by those people who are rarely if ever affected by the Muslim racism. Our liberal views and actions will surely carry on while we perform our own death knoll from our disappearing spires of our churches that preach only love and forgiveness &#8211; and blindly advise our people to &#8216;turn the other cheek&#8217; &#8211; how do you imagine a Muslim responds to us &#8216;turning the other cheek&#8217;? Quite right, they will also abuse our other cheek. Take heed &#8211; we are not only in a philosophical war &#8211; we are also in a physical war &#8211; the time to take action in our defence is NOW?</p>\n</div>\n        </div>\n\n    </li><!-- #comment-## -->\n            </ul>\n\n\n        </div>\n\n    </div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar disqus_url = 'http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/04/15/a-murder-in-paris-2/';\nvar disqus_identifier = '71596 http://www.dcclothesline.com/?p=71596';\nvar disqus_container_id = 'disqus_thread';\nvar disqus_shortname = 'dcclothesline';\nvar disqus_title = \"A Murder in Paris\";\nvar disqus_config_custom = window.disqus_config;\nvar disqus_config = function () {\n    /*\n    All currently supported events:\n    onReady: fires when everything is ready,\n    onNewComment: fires when a new comment is posted,\n    onIdentify: fires when user is authenticated\n    */\n    \n    \n    this.language = '';\n        this.callbacks.onReady.push(function () {\n\n        // sync comments in the background so we don't block the page\n        var script = document.createElement('script');\n        script.async = true;\n        script.src = '?cf_action=sync_comments&post_id=71596';\n\n        var firstScript = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];\n        firstScript.parentNode.insertBefore(script, firstScript);\n    });\n    \n    if (disqus_config_custom) {\n        disqus_config_custom.call(this);\n    }\n};\n\n(function() {\n    var dsq = document.createElement('script');

In the tragic comedy of denial that every Islamic terrorism investigation inevitably becomes, the authorities are still hunting around for his motive.\n\nThe media claims that her Muslim killer, like every other Muslim terrorist in the past two years, was mentally unstable. According to official reports, he was incoherent. According to other accounts, he told the police that he had followed the commands of the Koran. He certainly would not have been the first.\n\nThe street where Sarah Lucy\u2019s broken body lay was the Rue de Vaucouleurs. It\u2019s close to Belleville, a neighborhood whose name means \u201cBeautiful town\u201d, but which is better known these days as one of France\u2019s \u201cZones Urbaines Sensibles\u201d or \u201cSensitive Urban Zones.\u201d\n\nOr, without the euphemisms, parts of the beautiful town are really a \u201cNo Go Zone\u201d. Or, if you prefer the official descriptions, a vibrant, colorful and multicultural community full of delightfully exotic foods.\n\nTwo years ago, smirking media reporters had a field day visiting Belleville to show that FOX News reports about No Go Zones in France were nonsense. \u201cLook, at the couscous restaurants and colorful scarves, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\nUnless your delightfully multicultural Muslim neighbor decides to shove you through a window while shouting one of his religion\u2019s exotic genocidal epithets about the Jews and all infidels.\n\nBelleville was once home to many Jews. Then Jews from North Africa fled there after Muslim takeovers deprived them of the civil rights they had briefly enjoyed under French rule. And their Mohammedan oppressors followed. Some years back, the JTA ran one of its cheerful Islamophilic pieces about Belleville. \u201cIn one Paris neighborhood, Jews and Muslims live as they did in North Africa.\u201d\n\nThat is indeed true. Just not in the way that the JTA would like its gullible readers to believe.\n\nYonathan Halimi, Sarah Lucy\u2019s son, describes the killer\u2019s family as being known for its anti-Semitism. \u201cOne day, one of the killer\u2019s sisters pushed my sister down the stairs, and the next time she called her a dirty Jew,\u201d he described. Sarah\u2019s brother said that the killer called Sarah and her daughter, \u201cdirty Jews\u201d.\n\nThis is how Jews and Muslims lived in North Africa. This is how they lived everywhere under Muslim rule. Now this is how Jews and Muslims live in Paris and anywhere else settled by Islamic migration.\n\nHalimi is a common last name among North African Jews. It means that their ancestors once lived in Ksar Oulad Abd El Halim in Morocco. You can still find Stars of David on the buildings in Ksar Oulad Abd El Halim, but the Jews are all gone. There are Halimis in Paris. But not as many as there once were.\n\nA decade ago, Ilan Halimi was captured and tortured to death by monsters who styled themselves the \u201cGang of Barbarians\u201d. The barbarians left him dying by the side of the road with burns and stab wounds over most of his body while the police did their best to direct attention away from the inconvenient question of Muslim anti-Semitism. Since then the head of the Gang of Barbarians has managed to produce videos from jail in which he spews hatred at Jews and promotes Islamic terrorism.\n\nOn the day before Passover Eve, a thousand Jews gathered outside the building where the latest Halimi was murdered. As they memorialized Sarah Lucy Halimi, the colorful and multicultural settlers of this portion of occupied Paris, greeted them with thrown bottles and shouts of, \u201cDirty Jews\u201d.\n\nThe same taunt aimed at the Halimis by the Muslim killer and his occupying clan. Truly, Jews and Muslims live in Paris as they did in North Africa.\n\nBut the media always has its own spin on the Muslim murder of non-Muslims. As Le Figaro\u2019s account put it, the demonstrators \u201cdispersed\u201d after an \u201caltercation\u201d with the \u201cyoung people of the neighborhood\u201d.\n\nThe Jews, even though they lived here before the Islamic invasion arrived, are never the people of the neighborhood. Sarah Lucy Halimi had lived in her building for three decades. The Muslim family of her killer arrived at a later date and yet she remained an outsider to be murdered while Muslim violence and hatred is referred to only through euphemisms such as \u201cyouths of the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nWhen the marchers sang the French National Anthem in this terrible place, while an invading army of \u201cyouths\u201d watched, jeered and hooted from the windows, some of its lines had an ominous resonance.\n\n\u201cAgainst us tyranny\u2019s Bloody banner is raised.\u201d And indeed, the black flags of Islam can be seen flying in France\u2019s No Go Zones. \u201cThey are coming right into your arms. To cut the throats of your sons, your women!\u201d They are coming. And we take them in. We feed them, we clothe them and then they kill us.\n\nBut there was also the rising chorus of Hatikvah. Sarah Lucy Halimi, like her son, like so many other Halimis, has found her final home in Israel. Before the arrival of Passover, she made her own exodus.\n\n\u201cAn eternal flame will burn on the altar, it will not be extinguished,\u201d her son eulogized her with a quote from the Bible at her burial in Jerusalem. \u201cI can testify that she contained an eternal flame.\u201d\n\nThat is where the religion of Sarah Lucy Halimi differs so fundamentally from that of her killer. And where her God differs so fundamentally from Allah.\n\nThe Kaddish prayer for the dead that they recited both at the march and at her funeral has its similarities to Islam\u2019s Allahu Akbar with its ringing declaration, \u201cGlorified and sanctified be God\u2019s great name.\u201d But where Muslims declare the greatness of their deity when murdering Jews, Jews praise God when memorializing the victims of Islamic oppression because unlike Muslims they see death not as a gateway to an obscene orgy of carnal pleasures, but as the expression of the eternal flame of the soul.\n\nThe Muslim killer\u2019s shout of Allahu Akbar, his declaration of his deity\u2019s greatness at empowering him to throw a 66-year-old nursery school director out of a window, is really an indictment of Islam.\n\nThe first ever cry of \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d was uttered during Mohammed\u2019s massacre of the Jews of Khaibar. The murderous bandit who founded Islam had lain in wait for the Jews who cultivated palm trees in a desert oasis to emerge in the morning. When the Jews came out with spades to make the desert bloom, Muslims attacked the gardeners with weapons against which gardening tools are no match.\n\nMohammed shouted, \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d. That does not mean, as the phrase is often mistranslated, that Allah is great. Or as it is even more woefully mistranslated, God is great. For Allah is only the deity of Islam. Instead Mohammed shouted that his god was greater than the God of the Jews because Allah had enabled him to ambush unarmed men. Or to throw a 66-year-old nursery director out of a window.\n\n\u201cKhaybar Khaybar, ya yahud,\u201d remains a popular racist Muslim chant. Jews, remember Khaybar.\n\nKhaybar is worth remembering as is an elderly woman falling from the third floor to 30 Rue de Vaucouleurs, and every atrocity and act of racist Islamic terror in the 1,389 years in between.\n\nA war against humanity is underway. It began long ago. The killers shout, \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d. And their victims fall from New York City skyscrapers and third floor Parisian apartments. They are run over in London and Nice, shot in San Bernardino and Paris and blown up in Boston and Brussels.\n\nWe must remember all of them. And we must win the war.\n\nCourtesy of Sultan Knish", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_gray_20.png?w=584", "https://i2.wp.com/www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sarah-lucy-halami.jpg?fit=667%2C397", "https://i2.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/-xD3m26JDqhs/WO_ivDt_X0I/AAAAAAAAQI0/SwncZeC02xcjLMB38pnYLgLhu1p_SOpyQCLcB/s320/halimi.jpg?resize=320%2C166&ssl=1", "http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-cropped-dcc-header-5.jpg"], "videos": []}
