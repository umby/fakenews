Most people are living in an alternate reality created by those with the biggest platforms.<span id=\"more-70834\"></span></p>\n<p>Individual \u201creality\u201d is defined by what people believe to be true more than what actually exists. A firmly held opinion can create such a vast cognitive dissonance that many people can actually witness something that challenges their belief and still deny that they could be incorrect.</p>\n<p>This sounds like the biggest conspiracy theory ever, but if you are here reading this, you probably at least suspect that\u00a0there are manipulations at play in nearly everything we view or read. There are just a few hundred people who control the media, entertainment, and the internet, and unless we are completely unplugged, we are lambasted with their versions of reality relentlessly every day.</p>\n<div id=\"AdThrive_Content_1_desktop\" class=\"adthrive-ad adthrive-dynamic adthrive-content\" data-google-query-id=\"CLnzwNu17NICFRN4AQodNzUEfQ\"></div>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about how opinions are <em>really</em> formed and who has the influence to sway the people of America. No matter how well-informed a person tries to be, the truth can be hard to come by when bias is presented from so many primary sources.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Places People Get Their News and Information</strong></h2>\n<p>According to the Pew Research Group, people get their information from the following sources:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2016/07/PJ_2016.07.07_Modern-News-Consumer_1-01.png?w=640\" alt=\"About four-in-ten Americans often get news online\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/pathways-to-news/\">Photo Credit Journalism.org</a></h5>\n<p>This means that those with the power to influence are the people who pull the strings of network news, those in entertainment, those who make the rules of major social media platforms, and those with the biggest websites. Radio and print newspapers have little influence these days, and for that reason, most major print newspapers also have online outlets.</p>\n<p>Notice also how people of varying age groups rely more strongly on different sources for their information.</p>\n<div id=\"AdThrive_Content_2_desktop\" class=\"adthrive-ad adthrive-dynamic adthrive-content\" data-google-query-id=\"CLrzwNu17NICFRN4AQodNzUEfQ\"></div>\n<h2><strong>Network News</strong></h2>\n<p>Who remembers sitting at the table or just after dinner, being bored to tears as a little kid while your parents were glued to the evening news? \u00a0I remember my dad wanted to watch the news from three sources because he wanted more than one opinion. I get it now, but at the time, it felt like \u201cthe news\u201d would never be over. I usually ended up playing with my Barbies or reading a book.</p>\n<p>It seems that times haven\u2019t changed much, if the Pew survey cited above is to be believed, and it appears that the older people are, the more likely they are to watch the news on TV.</p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the catch.</p>\n<p>Although there are thousands of news stations across the country, nearly all of them are owned by six corporations. In the 80s, the stations were dispersed through about 50 different companies \u2013 not a lot but a far more diverse sampling than you have now that your news is filtered through\u00a0the lenses of billionaire corporations.</p>\n<p>So, basically, everything we hear on the news is\u00a0<a href=\"http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/who-owns-the-media-the-6-monolithic-corporations-that-control-almost-everything-we-watch-hear-and-read\">controlled by these six companies</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time Warner</li>\n<li>Walt Disney</li>\n<li>News Corp.</li>\n<li>Viacom</li>\n<li>CBS Corporation</li>\n<li>NBC Universal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever their opinions are, those are the biases from which your news will be presented.</p>\n<p>But it goes even deeper than just news\u00a0because these corporations also control the entertainment industry. And what better way to control the masses than through propagandized drama in which the abnormal is normalized, and agendas are insidiously promoted without the knowledge of an unaware watcher?</p>\n<p>Here is a glimpse at the networks owned by these corporations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10823 size-full\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership.jpg?resize=602%2C453\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership.jpg?resize=602%2C453 602w, http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership-150x113.jpg 150w, http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership-300x226.jpg 300w, http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership-65x49.jpg 65w, http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership-320x241.jpg 320w, http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership-133x100.jpg 133w, http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership-159x120.jpg 159w, http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership-390x293.jpg 390w, http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership-226x170.jpg 226w, http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/media-ownership-532x400.jpg 532w\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h5><a href=\"http://www.theglobalmovement.info/wp/areas-of-focus/global-financial-war/who-controls-the-media\">Photo Credit The Global Movement</a></h5>\n<p>As you can see, nearly anything you watch on any channel is influenced by a handful of people \u2013 those who run these major corporations. If they want to push an agenda, you can rest assured that agenda will be present on each of their outlets in some form.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Rulers of the Internet</strong></h2>\n<p>People under 50 get more of their news and information from the web than any other source these days.</p>\n<p>One hundred websites get the majority of the traffic on the internet, and that traffic is massive. The people behind these websites are major influences in the reality perceived by Americans.</p>\n<p>Think about this:</p>\n<p>Google gets 28 billion visits per month. That means when you look something up on Google, you are provided with the answer Google wants you to have, which may or may not be the actual answer.</p>\n<p>YouTube follows quickly behind with 20.5 billion visits. (<a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-17/visualizing-100-websites-rule-internet\">source</a>) I\u2019m sure by now you have heard that <a href=\"http://daisyluther.com/google-and-facebook-will-be-arbiters-of-truth-in-the-war-on-fake-news/\">YouTube has taken advertising privileges</a> away from a lot of videographers whose points of view are contrary to the agenda they wish to promote. They\u2019re saying that the content is not \u201cadvertiser friendly\u201d \u2013 and obviously, this discourages people who dedicate their days to advancing the truth from doing so.

Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you probably heard about Twitter permanently banning a bunch of popular Alt-Right people, most infamously, Milo Yiannopolis for his perspective.</p>\n<p>Now, personally, I\u2019m not a fan of the Alt-Right viewpoint. It seems like they\u2019re presenting meanness as \u201ctruth\u201d when they could just as easily state true things without being jerks about it. But that is beside the point. If these people are going to be banned for their unsavory ways of communicating, why does Twitter allow things like <a href=\"http://daisyluther.com/wheres-feminist-outrage-rapemelania-trends-twitter/\">#RapeMelania</a> to trend? Why does Twitter allow actual threats against the President? If you\u2019re going to start banning offensiveness, shouldn\u2019t it be across the board?</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s Facebook, who has actually been busted <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/technology/facebook-tinkers-with-users-emotions-in-news-feed-experiment-stirring-outcry.html\">running social experiments on its users by attempting to alter people\u2019s moods</a> with what they show in their timelines. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Nearly every blogger I know who works in the alternative news genre has been in Facebook jail at least once for presenting an unpopular opinion. I personally got warnings when I posted <a href=\"http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/is-civil-unrest-coming-to-suburbia-rest-assured-the-media-will-lie-about-it-08182016\">this article</a> on my page \u2013 the article was taken down dozens of times and reported as \u201chate speech\u201d when the \u201chate\u201d it reported on was certainly not MY hatred.</p>\n<p>Of course, when you sign up to use any of these social media networks, you agree to their terms and conditions. They\u2019re businesses and are under no obligation to be truthful or have integrity. Go ahead and use them \u2013 I do because they are helpful to my business \u2013 but do so fully aware that what you see presented there reflects the opinions of the management\u00a0and not actual reality.</p>\n<h2><strong>So how do we get the truth?</strong></h2>\n<p>There really aren\u2019t any unbiased sources out there. Having worked as an alternative journalist, I can tell you honestly that no matter how hard you try to be unbiased, your personal feelings sneak in, at least a little bit. Maybe it\u2019s with the background information you provide to support your story because you can see the direction what you are reporting on is going. Maybe it is with a little bit of snarky commentary or a pithy headline.</p>\n<p>Because of this, many people pick the reality in which they want to live. Maybe they select ultra-conservative websites that reflect their religious beliefs. Perhaps they opt for anti-establishment outlets that gleefully point out in a non-partisan fashion that all of the politicians are sell-outs. For others, they want \u201cnews\u201d that supports their warm, fuzzy liberal view of the world.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty easy to get manipulated through the subliminal messages and the predictive programming, but some folks seem to be immune. You really want to be one of those people, and if you aren\u2019t, you can get there.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http://daisyluther.com/not-just-a-conspiracy-theory-how-subliminal-messaging-and-predictive-programming-are-really-used/\">wrote about this</a> previously:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What if some people are genetically more susceptible than others? What if some of us are immune to this constant bombardment of images, words, and ideas that most people seem to buy into without question?</p>\n<p>Could this be the difference between the vast majority of the people and those of us are that are awake and aware? Are we just mutants? Is this why I can explain this stuff until I lose my voice and just get a blank stare from people who think I am the crazy one?</p>\n<p>The vast majority of people in the United States are\u00a0completely accepting of the official message:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They believe that the government will be there to save them in all circumstances.</li>\n<li>They don\u2019t question or inquire. They simply accept what they are told.</li>\n<li>They don\u2019t share our fears that something big is on the horizon.</li>\n<li>They exist in a bubble and don\u2019t look at the bigger picture.</li>\n<li>They refuse to prepare for bad things because they honestly don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible that those things will happen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most people like <em>us</em>\u00a0(those who are aware, the self-sufficient minority) watch less TV than the masses. Some of us watch no TV at all. I watch a few shows on Netflix or Amazon Prime, but we don\u2019t have cable TV with its commercials and *cough* news. We have other things to do, things that will help us when there are soldiers on the streets \u201c<em>for our own protection.\u201d</em>\u00a0Things that will help our kids survive when the store shelves are empty and the majority relies on government rations to live (if they behave well enough to get one that is, and behave they will because hunger is a massive motivator to do as you\u2019re told.)</p>\n<p>Even if you have a tendency to be mind-controlled, it\u2019s possible to snap out of it. I wasn\u2019t always the tinfoil-clad blogger you see before you today. When I was in my early 20s, I truly did believe that the government agencies like the <a href=\"http://daisyluther.com/the-epa-theyre-protecting-someone-but-it-isnt-you/\">EPA</a> and the <a href=\"http://daisyluther.com/20-things-the-fda-federal-deception-administration-doesnt-want-you-to-know/\">FDA</a> were looking out for our best interests, that food or medicine wouldn\u2019t be sold if it was harmful, and that schools truly were in the business of educating children. \u00a0Most of us have to shake off our early training at the hands of the education system and the television.</p>\n<p>And sort of like in the movie, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2eg1kyk\">The Matrix</a>, if you can get someone to swallow the red pill, they become a lot less willing to believe whatever they\u2019re fed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/s.quickmeme.com/img/08/08b961a0eacb4fb896b16e34e57427ec89744456a68e48827b5aea1ff8b9c233.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for matrix red pill blue pill meme\" width=\"799\" height=\"378\" /></p>\n<p>Subliminal messaging can change people\u2019s views, can change the way they think, can change what they want to eat, what car they want to buy, maybe even how they vote. All you need is the cash to get your message out there and buy a few split seconds of screen time.</p>\n<p>It can sow the seeds that make acceptance of abnormal and dangerous situations easier. It can teach people not to question and to be good little sheep.</p>\n<p>Sitting for hours in front of the television mindlessly watching the drivel produced by companies who call it \u201centertainment\u201d is brainwashing people and turning them into idiots, making the best current day example of predictive programming the movie\u00a0<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2dWJf3Y\">Idiocracy</a>.</p>\n<p>All you have to do is look around and you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s here.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>What if you don\u2019t want to live in an alternate reality created by the media?</strong></h2>\n<p>First of all, this doesn\u2019t even touch on other influences like the ridiculous <a href=\"http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/setting-the-stage-for-tyranny-public-schools-deliberately-create-a-culture-of-fear-04062014\">fear culture</a> perpetuated in our schools or the Marxist indoctrination in our colleges and universities, where they teach you that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T79dSYrjMQ0&amp;t=402s\">gender isn\u2019t a real thing and you get to pick whenever you want</a>. There are many more players in the alternate reality game than just the media, but you have to start somewhere.</p>\n<p>My advice for those who don\u2019t want to live in an alternate reality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn off the TV.</li>\n<li>Vet your sources.</li>\n<li>Try to get several points of view \u2013 even the ones you don\u2019t like. The truth lies somewhere in between.</li>\n<li>Look out for talking points that are used <em>ad infinitum</em> like \u201cdeep state\u201d or \u201cwith an abundance of caution\u201d \u00a0or \u201cthe Russians.\u201d The things you hear repeated over and over are repeated for a reason \u2013 to brainwash you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the famous words of Fox Mulder, \u201c<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2mQu1Sk\">The truth is out there</a>.\u201d You just have to seek it diligently.</p>\n<p><em>Daisy is a coffee-swigging, gun-toting, homeschooling blogger who writes about current events, preparedness, frugality, and the pursuit of liberty on her websites, <a href=\"http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/sign-daily-newsletter\">The Organic Prepper</a> and <a href=\"http://daisyluther.com/\">DaisyLuther.com </a>She is the author of <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2h3c5S1\">4 books</a> and the co-founder of <a href=\"https://preppersuniversity.com/\">Preppers University</a>, where she teaches intensive preparedness courses in a live online classroom setting.

There are just a few hundred people who control the media, entertainment, and the internet, and unless we are completely unplugged, we are lambasted with their versions of reality relentlessly every day.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about how opinions are really formed and who has the influence to sway the people of America. No matter how well-informed a person tries to be, the truth can be hard to come by when bias is presented from so many primary sources.\n\nThe Places People Get Their News and Information\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Group, people get their information from the following sources:\n\nThis means that those with the power to influence are the people who pull the strings of network news, those in entertainment, those who make the rules of major social media platforms, and those with the biggest websites. Radio and print newspapers have little influence these days, and for that reason, most major print newspapers also have online outlets.\n\nNotice also how people of varying age groups rely more strongly on different sources for their information.\n\nNetwork News\n\nWho remembers sitting at the table or just after dinner, being bored to tears as a little kid while your parents were glued to the evening news? I remember my dad wanted to watch the news from three sources because he wanted more than one opinion. I get it now, but at the time, it felt like \u201cthe news\u201d would never be over. I usually ended up playing with my Barbies or reading a book.\n\nIt seems that times haven\u2019t changed much, if the Pew survey cited above is to be believed, and it appears that the older people are, the more likely they are to watch the news on TV.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch.\n\nAlthough there are thousands of news stations across the country, nearly all of them are owned by six corporations. In the 80s, the stations were dispersed through about 50 different companies \u2013 not a lot but a far more diverse sampling than you have now that your news is filtered through the lenses of billionaire corporations.\n\nSo, basically, everything we hear on the news is controlled by these six companies:\n\nTime Warner\n\nWalt Disney\n\nNews Corp.\n\nViacom\n\nCBS Corporation\n\nNBC Universal\n\nWhatever their opinions are, those are the biases from which your news will be presented.\n\nBut it goes even deeper than just news because these corporations also control the entertainment industry. And what better way to control the masses than through propagandized drama in which the abnormal is normalized, and agendas are insidiously promoted without the knowledge of an unaware watcher?\n\nHere is a glimpse at the networks owned by these corporations.\n\nAs you can see, nearly anything you watch on any channel is influenced by a handful of people \u2013 those who run these major corporations. If they want to push an agenda, you can rest assured that agenda will be present on each of their outlets in some form.\n\nThe Rulers of the Internet\n\nPeople under 50 get more of their news and information from the web than any other source these days.\n\nOne hundred websites get the majority of the traffic on the internet, and that traffic is massive. The people behind these websites are major influences in the reality perceived by Americans.\n\nThink about this:\n\nGoogle gets 28 billion visits per month. That means when you look something up on Google, you are provided with the answer Google wants you to have, which may or may not be the actual answer.\n\nYouTube follows quickly behind with 20.5 billion visits. (source) I\u2019m sure by now you have heard that YouTube has taken advertising privileges away from a lot of videographers whose points of view are contrary to the agenda they wish to promote. They\u2019re saying that the content is not \u201cadvertiser friendly\u201d \u2013 and obviously, this discourages people who dedicate their days to advancing the truth from doing so. They too must make a living, and video editing is a time-consuming process. One well-done 10-minute video can take 8 hours to produce.\n\nThese are the 100 websites that provide the \u201creality\u201d for the majority of the people who rely on the internet for their news, as per Alexa.com\u2019s traffic reporting system.\n\nSocial Media\n\nYou may have noticed in the infographic above that a massive amount of traffic goes to social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBoth of those networks are notorious for censoring points of view that are not part of a liberal outlook. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you probably heard about Twitter permanently banning a bunch of popular Alt-Right people, most infamously, Milo Yiannopolis for his perspective.\n\nNow, personally, I\u2019m not a fan of the Alt-Right viewpoint. It seems like they\u2019re presenting meanness as \u201ctruth\u201d when they could just as easily state true things without being jerks about it. But that is beside the point. If these people are going to be banned for their unsavory ways of communicating, why does Twitter allow things like #RapeMelania to trend? Why does Twitter allow actual threats against the President? If you\u2019re going to start banning offensiveness, shouldn\u2019t it be across the board?\n\nThen there\u2019s Facebook, who has actually been busted running social experiments on its users by attempting to alter people\u2019s moods with what they show in their timelines. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Nearly every blogger I know who works in the alternative news genre has been in Facebook jail at least once for presenting an unpopular opinion. I personally got warnings when I posted this article on my page \u2013 the article was taken down dozens of times and reported as \u201chate speech\u201d when the \u201chate\u201d it reported on was certainly not MY hatred.\n\nOf course, when you sign up to use any of these social media networks, you agree to their terms and conditions. They\u2019re businesses and are under no obligation to be truthful or have integrity. Go ahead and use them \u2013 I do because they are helpful to my business \u2013 but do so fully aware that what you see presented there reflects the opinions of the management and not actual reality.\n\nSo how do we get the truth?\n\nThere really aren\u2019t any unbiased sources out there. Having worked as an alternative journalist, I can tell you honestly that no matter how hard you try to be unbiased, your personal feelings sneak in, at least a little bit. Maybe it\u2019s with the background information you provide to support your story because you can see the direction what you are reporting on is going. Maybe it is with a little bit of snarky commentary or a pithy headline.\n\nBecause of this, many people pick the reality in which they want to live. Maybe they select ultra-conservative websites that reflect their religious beliefs. Perhaps they opt for anti-establishment outlets that gleefully point out in a non-partisan fashion that all of the politicians are sell-outs. For others, they want \u201cnews\u201d that supports their warm, fuzzy liberal view of the world.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to get manipulated through the subliminal messages and the predictive programming, but some folks seem to be immune. You really want to be one of those people, and if you aren\u2019t, you can get there.\n\nI wrote about this previously:\n\nWhat if some people are genetically more susceptible than others? What if some of us are immune to this constant bombardment of images, words, and ideas that most people seem to buy into without question? Could this be the difference between the vast majority of the people and those of us are that are awake and aware? Are we just mutants? Is this why I can explain this stuff until I lose my voice and just get a blank stare from people who think I am the crazy one? The vast majority of people in the United States are completely accepting of the official message: They believe that the government will be there to save them in all circumstances.\n\nThey don\u2019t question or inquire. They simply accept what they are told.\n\nThey don\u2019t share our fears that something big is on the horizon.\n\nThey exist in a bubble and don\u2019t look at the bigger picture.\n\nThey refuse to prepare for bad things because they honestly don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible that those things will happen. Most people like us (those who are aware, the self-sufficient minority) watch less TV than the masses. Some of us watch no TV at all. I watch a few shows on Netflix or Amazon Prime, but we don\u2019t have cable TV with its commercials and *cough* news. We have other things to do, things that will help us when there are soldiers on the streets \u201cfor our own protection.\u201d Things that will help our kids survive when the store shelves are empty and the majority relies on government rations to live (if they behave well enough to get one that is, and behave they will because hunger is a massive motivator to do as you\u2019re told.) Even if you have a tendency to be mind-controlled, it\u2019s possible to snap out of it. I wasn\u2019t always the tinfoil-clad blogger you see before you today. When I was in my early 20s, I truly did believe that the government agencies like the EPA and the FDA were looking out for our best interests, that food or medicine wouldn\u2019t be sold if it was harmful, and that schools truly were in the business of educating children. Most of us have to shake off our early training at the hands of the education system and the television. And sort of like in the movie, The Matrix, if you can get someone to swallow the red pill, they become a lot less willing to believe whatever they\u2019re fed. Subliminal messaging can change people\u2019s views, can change the way they think, can change what they want to eat, what car they want to buy, maybe even how they vote. All you need is the cash to get your message out there and buy a few split seconds of screen time. It can sow the seeds that make acceptance of abnormal and dangerous situations easier. It can teach people not to question and to be good little sheep. Sitting for hours in front of the television mindlessly watching the drivel produced by companies who call it \u201centertainment\u201d is brainwashing people and turning them into idiots, making the best current day example of predictive programming the movie Idiocracy. All you have to do is look around and you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s here.\n\nWhat if you don\u2019t want to live in an alternate reality created by the media?\n\nFirst of all, this doesn\u2019t even touch on other influences like the ridiculous fear culture perpetuated in our schools or the Marxist indoctrination in our colleges and universities, where they teach you that gender isn\u2019t a real thing and you get to pick whenever you want. There are many more players in the alternate reality game than just the media, but you have to start somewhere.\n\nMy advice for those who don\u2019t want to live in an alternate reality:\n\nTurn off the TV.\n\nVet your sources.\n\nTry to get several points of view \u2013 even the ones you don\u2019t like. The truth lies somewhere in between.\n\nLook out for talking points that are used ad infinitum like \u201cdeep state\u201d or \u201cwith an abundance of caution\u201d or \u201cthe Russians.\u201d The things you hear repeated over and over are repeated for a reason \u2013 to brainwash you.\n\nIn the famous words of Fox Mulder, \u201cThe truth is out there.\u201d You just have to seek it diligently.\n\nDaisy is a coffee-swigging, gun-toting, homeschooling blogger who writes about current events, preparedness, frugality, and the pursuit of liberty on her websites, The Organic Prepper and DaisyLuther.com She is the author of 4 books and the co-founder of Preppers University, where she teaches intensive preparedness courses in a live online classroom setting.
