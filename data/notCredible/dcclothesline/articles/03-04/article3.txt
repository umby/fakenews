It\u2019s a crucial piece of history that has been ignored by mass media.<span id=\"more-70172\"></span></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve published this interview before. Here I want to make new comments.</p>\n<p>First of all, David Rockefeller\u2019s Trilateral Commission was born in 1973, in part because the Globalist plan to ensure \u201cfree trade\u201d (no tariffs paid by predatory mega-corporations) had run into a glitch.</p>\n<p>That glitch was President Richard Nixon. He began laying tariffs on certain goods imported into the US, in order to level the playing field and protect American companies. Nixon, a substantial crook in other respects, went off-script in this case and actually started a movement to reject the Globalist vision.</p>\n<p>After Nixon\u2019s ouster from the White House, Gerald Ford became president, and he chose David\u2019s brother, Nelson Rockefeller as his vice-president. It was a sign Globalism and free trade were back on track.</p>\n<p>But David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Brzezinski, wanted more. They wanted a man in the White House whom they\u2019d created from scratch.</p>\n<p>That man was a peanut farmer no one had ever heard of: Jimmy Carter.</p>\n<p>Through their media connections, David and Brzezinski vaulted Carter into the spotlight. He won the Democratic nomination (1976), spread a syrupy message of love and coming together after the Watergate debacle, and soon he was ensconced in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>Flash forward to 1978, the second year of Carter\u2019s presidency. An interview took place.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a close-up snap shot of a remarkable moment. It\u2019s a through-the-looking-glass secret\u2014in the form of a conversation between a reporter, Jeremiah Novak, and two Trilateral Commission members, Karl Kaiser and Richard Cooper.</p>\n<p>The interview concerned the issue of who exactly, during President Carter\u2019s administration, was formulating and controlling US economic and political policy.</p>\n<p>The careless and off-hand attitude of Trilateralists Kaiser and Cooper is astonishing. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re saying, \u201cWhat we\u2019re revealing is already out in the open, it\u2019s too late to do anything about it, why are you so worked up, we\u2019ve already won\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>NOVAK (the reporter): Is it true that a private [Trilateral committee] led by Henry Owen of the US and made up of [Trilateral] representatives of the US, UK, West Germany, Japan, France and the EEC is coordinating the economic and political policies of the Trilateral countries [which would include the US]?</p>\n<p>COOPER: Yes, they have met three times.</p>\n<p>NOVAK: Yet, in your recent paper you state that this committee should remain informal because to formalize \u2018this function might well prove offensive to some of the Trilateral and other countries which do not take part.\u2019 Who are you afraid of?</p>\n<p>KAISER: Many countries in Europe would resent the dominant role that West Germany plays at these [Trilateral] meetings.</p>\n<p>COOPER: Many people still live in a world of separate nations [!], and they would resent such coordination [of policy].</p>\n<p>NOVAK: But this [Trilateral] committee is essential to your whole policy. How can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular support [for its decisions on how Trilateral member nations will conduct their economic and political policies]?</p>\n<p>COOPER: Well, I guess it\u2019s the press\u2019 job to publicize it.</p>\n<p>NOVAK: Yes, but why doesn\u2019t President Carter come out with it and tell the American people that [US] economic and political power is being coordinated by a [Trilateral] committee made up of Henry Owen and six others? After all, if [US] policy is being made on a multinational level, the people should know.</p>\n<p>COOPER: President Carter and Secretary of State Vance have constantly alluded to this in their speeches.</p>\n<p>KAISER: It just hasn\u2019t become an issue.</p>\n<p>SOURCE: \u201cTrilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World Management,\u201d ed. by Holly Sklar, 1980. South End Press, Boston. Pages 192-3.</p>\n<p>Of course, although Kaiser and Cooper claimed everything being manipulated by the Trilateral Commission committee was already out in the open, it wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Their interview slipped under the mainstream media radar, which is to say, it was ignored and buried. It didn\u2019t become a scandal on the level of, say, Watergate, although its essence was far larger than Watergate.</p>\n<p>US economic and political policy run by a committee of the Trilateral Commission\u2014the Commission had been created in 1973 as an \u201cinformal discussion group\u201d by David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Brzezinski, who would become Jimmy Carter\u2019s National Security Advisor.</p><div class=\"wpInsert wpInsertInPostAd wpInsertMiddle\" style=\"margin: 5px; padding: 0px;\"><div id=\"ld-2901-1196\"></div><script>(function(w,d,s,i){w.ldAdInit=w.ldAdInit||[];w.ldAdInit.push({slot:8985198184511335,size:[0, 0],id:\"ld-2901-1196\"});if(!d.getElementById(i)){var j=d.createElement(s),p=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];j.async=true;j.src=\"//cdn2.lockerdome.com/_js/ajs.js\";j.id=i;p.parentNode.insertBefore(j,p);}})(window,document,\"script\",\"ld-ajs\");</script></div>\n<p>Shortly after Carter won the presidential election, his aide, Hamilton Jordan, said that if after the inauguration, Cy Vance and Brzezinski came on board as secretary of state and national security adviser, \u201cWe have lost. And I will quit.\u201d Lost\u2014because both men were powerful members of the Trilateral Commission and their appointment to key positions would signal a surrender of White House control to the Commission.</p>\n<p>Vance and Brzezinski were appointed secretary of state and national security adviser, as Jordan feared. But he didn\u2019t quit. He became Carter\u2019s chief of staff.</p>\n<p>Flash forward again, to the Obama administration.</p>\n<p>In the run-up to his inauguration after the 2008 presidential election, Obama was tutored by the co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, Zbigniew Brzezinski.</p>\n<p>Four years before birthing the Commission with his boss of bosses, David Rockefeller, Brzezinski wrote: \u201c[The] nation state as a fundamental unit of man\u2019s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force. International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state.\u201d</p>\n<p>Goodbye, separate nations.</p>\n<p>Any doubt on the question of Trialteral goals is answered by David Rockefeller himself, in his Memoirs (2003): \u201cSome even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as \u2018internationalists\u2019 and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure\u2014one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Patrick Wood, author of Trilaterals Over Washington and Technocracy Rising, points out there are only 87 members of the Trilateral Commission who live in America.</p>\n<p>Obama appointed eleven of them to posts in his administration.</p>\n<p>For example: Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary;<br />\nJames Jones, National Security Advisor;<br />\nPaul Volker, Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee;<br />\nDennis Blair, Director of National Intelligence.</p>\n<p>Here is the payoff. The US Trade Representative (appointed by Obama in 2013), who was responsible for negotiating the Globalist TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) treaty with 11 other nations, was Michael Froman, a former member of the Trilateral Commission. Don\u2019t let the word \u201cformer\u201d fool you. Commission members resign when they take positions in the Executive Branch of government. And when they serve in vital positions, such as US Trade Representative, they aren\u2019t there by accident. They\u2019re operatives with a specific agenda.</p>\n<p>Flash forward one more time. Trump, who squashed the Globalist TPP treaty as soon as he was inaugurated, has been busy making staff appointments. Patrick Wood writes (2/6/17):</p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to a White House press release, the first member of the Trilateral Commission has entered the Trump administration as the Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs, where he will sit on the National Security Council:</p>\n<p>\u201cKenneth I. Juster will serve as Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs. He will coordinate the Administration\u2019s international economic policy and integrate it with national security and foreign policy. He will also be the President\u2019s representative and lead U.S. negotiator (\u201cSherpa\u201d) for the annual G-7, G-20, and APEC Summits.\u201d</p>\n<p>Juster\u2019s duties will take him into the heart of high-level negotiations with foreign governments on economic policy.</p>\n<p>Keep your eye on Mr. Juster. Will he take actions in line with Trump\u2019s avowed anti-Globalist stance?</p>\n<p>Or will Juster work as one more covert Trilateral operative in the center of American decision-making?</p>\n<p>If the answer is \u201ccovert operative,\u201d does Trump know this? Does he condone what Mr. Juster will do?</p>\n<p>Or is this a case of secret infiltration, on behalf the most powerful Globalist group in the world, the Trilateral Commission?</p>\n<p><em>Jon Rappoport</em></p>\n<p><em>To read about Jon\u2019s mega-collection, <strong>The Matrix Revealed</strong>, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>The author of three explosive collections, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/the-matrix-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\">THE MATRIX REVEALED</a>, <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/exit-from-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">EXIT FROM THE MATRIX</a>, and <a href=\"http://marketplace.mybigcommerce.com/power-outside-the-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX</a>, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29<sup>th</sup> District of California.

Trilateral Members interviewed \u2014 admitted they controlled the government", "url": "http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/03/04/bombshell-flashback-trilateral-members-interviewed-admitted-they-controlled-the-government/", "date": "03-04-2017", "source": "dcclothesline", "text": "This is a bombshell. It\u2019s a crucial piece of history that has been ignored by mass media.\n\nI\u2019ve published this interview before. Here I want to make new comments.\n\nFirst of all, David Rockefeller\u2019s Trilateral Commission was born in 1973, in part because the Globalist plan to ensure \u201cfree trade\u201d (no tariffs paid by predatory mega-corporations) had run into a glitch.\n\nThat glitch was President Richard Nixon. He began laying tariffs on certain goods imported into the US, in order to level the playing field and protect American companies. Nixon, a substantial crook in other respects, went off-script in this case and actually started a movement to reject the Globalist vision.\n\nAfter Nixon\u2019s ouster from the White House, Gerald Ford became president, and he chose David\u2019s brother, Nelson Rockefeller as his vice-president. It was a sign Globalism and free trade were back on track.\n\nBut David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Brzezinski, wanted more. They wanted a man in the White House whom they\u2019d created from scratch.\n\nThat man was a peanut farmer no one had ever heard of: Jimmy Carter.\n\nThrough their media connections, David and Brzezinski vaulted Carter into the spotlight. He won the Democratic nomination (1976), spread a syrupy message of love and coming together after the Watergate debacle, and soon he was ensconced in the Oval Office.\n\nFlash forward to 1978, the second year of Carter\u2019s presidency. An interview took place.\n\nIt\u2019s a close-up snap shot of a remarkable moment. It\u2019s a through-the-looking-glass secret\u2014in the form of a conversation between a reporter, Jeremiah Novak, and two Trilateral Commission members, Karl Kaiser and Richard Cooper.\n\nThe interview concerned the issue of who exactly, during President Carter\u2019s administration, was formulating and controlling US economic and political policy.\n\nThe careless and off-hand attitude of Trilateralists Kaiser and Cooper is astonishing. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re saying, \u201cWhat we\u2019re revealing is already out in the open, it\u2019s too late to do anything about it, why are you so worked up, we\u2019ve already won\u2026\u201d\n\nNOVAK (the reporter): Is it true that a private [Trilateral committee] led by Henry Owen of the US and made up of [Trilateral] representatives of the US, UK, West Germany, Japan, France and the EEC is coordinating the economic and political policies of the Trilateral countries [which would include the US]?\n\nCOOPER: Yes, they have met three times.\n\nNOVAK: Yet, in your recent paper you state that this committee should remain informal because to formalize \u2018this function might well prove offensive to some of the Trilateral and other countries which do not take part.\u2019 Who are you afraid of?\n\nKAISER: Many countries in Europe would resent the dominant role that West Germany plays at these [Trilateral] meetings.\n\nCOOPER: Many people still live in a world of separate nations [!], and they would resent such coordination [of policy].\n\nNOVAK: But this [Trilateral] committee is essential to your whole policy. How can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular support [for its decisions on how Trilateral member nations will conduct their economic and political policies]?\n\nCOOPER: Well, I guess it\u2019s the press\u2019 job to publicize it.\n\nNOVAK: Yes, but why doesn\u2019t President Carter come out with it and tell the American people that [US] economic and political power is being coordinated by a [Trilateral] committee made up of Henry Owen and six others? After all, if [US] policy is being made on a multinational level, the people should know.\n\nCOOPER: President Carter and Secretary of State Vance have constantly alluded to this in their speeches.\n\nKAISER: It just hasn\u2019t become an issue.\n\nSOURCE: \u201cTrilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World Management,\u201d ed. by Holly Sklar, 1980. South End Press, Boston. Pages 192-3.\n\nOf course, although Kaiser and Cooper claimed everything being manipulated by the Trilateral Commission committee was already out in the open, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nTheir interview slipped under the mainstream media radar, which is to say, it was ignored and buried. It didn\u2019t become a scandal on the level of, say, Watergate, although its essence was far larger than Watergate.\n\nUS economic and political policy run by a committee of the Trilateral Commission\u2014the Commission had been created in 1973 as an \u201cinformal discussion group\u201d by David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Brzezinski, who would become Jimmy Carter\u2019s National Security Advisor.\n\nShortly after Carter won the presidential election, his aide, Hamilton Jordan, said that if after the inauguration, Cy Vance and Brzezinski came on board as secretary of state and national security adviser, \u201cWe have lost. And I will quit.\u201d Lost\u2014because both men were powerful members of the Trilateral Commission and their appointment to key positions would signal a surrender of White House control to the Commission.\n\nVance and Brzezinski were appointed secretary of state and national security adviser, as Jordan feared. But he didn\u2019t quit. He became Carter\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nFlash forward again, to the Obama administration.\n\nIn the run-up to his inauguration after the 2008 presidential election, Obama was tutored by the co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n\nFour years before birthing the Commission with his boss of bosses, David Rockefeller, Brzezinski wrote: \u201c[The] nation state as a fundamental unit of man\u2019s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force. International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state.\u201d\n\nGoodbye, separate nations.\n\nAny doubt on the question of Trialteral goals is answered by David Rockefeller himself, in his Memoirs (2003): \u201cSome even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as \u2018internationalists\u2019 and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure\u2014one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.\u201d\n\nPatrick Wood, author of Trilaterals Over Washington and Technocracy Rising, points out there are only 87 members of the Trilateral Commission who live in America.\n\nObama appointed eleven of them to posts in his administration.\n\nFor example: Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary;\n\nJames Jones, National Security Advisor;\n\nPaul Volker, Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee;\n\nDennis Blair, Director of National Intelligence.\n\nHere is the payoff. The US Trade Representative (appointed by Obama in 2013), who was responsible for negotiating the Globalist TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) treaty with 11 other nations, was Michael Froman, a former member of the Trilateral Commission. Don\u2019t let the word \u201cformer\u201d fool you. Commission members resign when they take positions in the Executive Branch of government. And when they serve in vital positions, such as US Trade Representative, they aren\u2019t there by accident. They\u2019re operatives with a specific agenda.\n\nFlash forward one more time. Trump, who squashed the Globalist TPP treaty as soon as he was inaugurated, has been busy making staff appointments. Patrick Wood writes (2/6/17):\n\n\u201cAccording to a White House press release, the first member of the Trilateral Commission has entered the Trump administration as the Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs, where he will sit on the National Security Council:\n\n\u201cKenneth I. Juster will serve as Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs. He will coordinate the Administration\u2019s international economic policy and integrate it with national security and foreign policy. He will also be the President\u2019s representative and lead U.S. negotiator (\u201cSherpa\u201d) for the annual G-7, G-20, and APEC Summits.\u201d\n\nJuster\u2019s duties will take him into the heart of high-level negotiations with foreign governments on economic policy.\n\nKeep your eye on Mr. Juster. Will he take actions in line with Trump\u2019s avowed anti-Globalist stance?\n\nOr will Juster work as one more covert Trilateral operative in the center of American decision-making?\n\nIf the answer is \u201ccovert operative,\u201d does Trump know this? Does he condone what Mr. Juster will do?\n\nOr is this a case of secret infiltration, on behalf the most powerful Globalist group in the world, the Trilateral Commission?\n\nJon Rappoport\n\nTo read about Jon\u2019s mega-collection, The Matrix Revealed, click here.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
