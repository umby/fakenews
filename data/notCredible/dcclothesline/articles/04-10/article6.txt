retaliation for an equally disputed chemical \u2018attack,\u2019 in which as many as 86 people <span id=\"more-71450\"></span>perished at the alleged hands of the Syrian Arab Army on the literal eve of peace talks is being criticized by experts and cagey politicians at every level of government \u2014 including former CIA officer Philip Giraldi.</p>\n<p>That Russian forces or those of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would gas to death scores of guiltless civilians is nothing short of a \u201csham,\u201d according to grumblings within the U.S. Intelligence Community.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump managed this injudicious assault with 59 Tomahawk missiles on a sovereign nation without even the pretext of <a href=\"http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/04/08/remember-when-trumps-ag-scolded-obamas-secretary-of-defense-for-not-getting-military-authorization-for-war-in-libya/\" target=\"_blank\">congressional approval</a>, prior to cursory investigation, and in clear violation of domestic and international law, with results expectedly dire \u2014 including the deaths of at least nine civilians \u2014 four of them, children.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Washington\u2019s neocon war hawks and their counterparts overseas couldn\u2019t heap sanctimonious praise on the now-apparently-interventionist president\u2019s reckless provocation quickly enough \u2014 nor could members of various terror groups.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others weren\u2019t as quick to beat the Petro-Industrial Complex\u2019s war drums \u2014 lampooning the reckless endeavor as an unjustified action based on unsubstantiated reports, and likely a war crime.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Worse, the whole affair reeks of the tidiness so oft characterizing a manufactured event \u2014 an issue award-winning investigative journalist and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consortiumnews</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> editor, Robert Parry, posits could be </span><a href=\"https://consortiumnews.com/2017/04/07/trumps-wag-the-dog-moment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the president\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018Wag the Dog\u2019</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> moment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, not everything is as cut and dry as Trump\u2019s War Machine would prefer you believe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did not have as strong a backing as implied, when, Thursday night, he </span><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/secretary-tillerson-russia-complicit-or-simply-incompetent-syrian-chemical-weapons-n743686\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">claimed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the U.S. Intelligence Community had assessed with a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Syrian government forces had unleashed a toxic chemical bomb against innocent civilians in Khan Sheikhoun in Syria\u2019s Idlib Governate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Parry notes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201ca number of intelligence sources have made contradictory assessments, saying the preponderance of evidence suggests that Al Qaeda-affiliated rebels were at fault, either by orchestrating an intentional release of a chemical agent as a provocation or by possessing containers of poison gas that ruptured during a conventional bombing raid.</span></i></p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne intelligence source told me that the most likely scenario <strong>was a staged event by the rebels intended to force Trump to reverse a policy,</strong> announced only days earlier, that the U.S. government would no longer seek \u2018regime change\u2019 in Syria and would focus on attacking the common enemy, Islamic terror groups that represent the core of the rebel forces.</span></i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe source said the Trump national security team split between the President\u2019s close personal advisers, such as nationalist firebrand Steve Bannon and son-in-law Jared Kushner, on one side and old-line neocons who have regrouped under National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, an Army general who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of neocon favorite Gen.

It&#8217;s almost a certainty the gas attack was a false flag by those who want Assad gone yesterday and saw their hopes vanishing fast away in light of Tillerson&#8217;s announcement the U.S. was stepping out of the Syrian conflict. The reality is Trump&#8217;s attack actually wound up being an attack on Syrian Christians (whether he knew it or not). However, this article fails, as it is too skewed to be taken seriously.

It has been an-<br />\nnounced that the gas that was used, was Sarin.  The first responders were not dressed to respond to Sarin gas, therefore, more than likely, it was Mustard Gas.  If Assad still maintains these chemical weapons, then both he and Putin, are guilty of not carrying out the agreement that Assad would reveal ALL of his chemical weapons, and  not retain any?  In addition, what global agency varified in 2013, that Assad&#8217;s chemical weapons no longer existed?  I have not heard of any.  As I have imparted in the past, Muslims are not to be trusted.  Assad is a Muslim, and Putin is a Communist, therefore, what a great combination of liars that these two turds, represent, and planet Earth believed at the time, that Assad&#8217;s Chemical weapons were on their way to be destroyed.

"date": "04-10-2017", "source": "dcclothesline", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s fraught and highly illegal attack on Syria this week in retaliation for an equally disputed chemical \u2018attack,\u2019 in which as many as 86 people perished at the alleged hands of the Syrian Arab Army on the literal eve of peace talks is being criticized by experts and cagey politicians at every level of government \u2014 including former CIA officer Philip Giraldi.\n\nThat Russian forces or those of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would gas to death scores of guiltless civilians is nothing short of a \u201csham,\u201d according to grumblings within the U.S. Intelligence Community.\n\nTrump managed this injudicious assault with 59 Tomahawk missiles on a sovereign nation without even the pretext of congressional approval, prior to cursory investigation, and in clear violation of domestic and international law, with results expectedly dire \u2014 including the deaths of at least nine civilians \u2014 four of them, children.\n\nWashington\u2019s neocon war hawks and their counterparts overseas couldn\u2019t heap sanctimonious praise on the now-apparently-interventionist president\u2019s reckless provocation quickly enough \u2014 nor could members of various terror groups.\n\nOthers weren\u2019t as quick to beat the Petro-Industrial Complex\u2019s war drums \u2014 lampooning the reckless endeavor as an unjustified action based on unsubstantiated reports, and likely a war crime.\n\nWorse, the whole affair reeks of the tidiness so oft characterizing a manufactured event \u2014 an issue award-winning investigative journalist and Consortiumnews editor, Robert Parry, posits could be the president\u2019s \u2018Wag the Dog\u2019 moment.\n\nIn short, not everything is as cut and dry as Trump\u2019s War Machine would prefer you believe.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson did not have as strong a backing as implied, when, Thursday night, he claimed the U.S. Intelligence Community had assessed with a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d Syrian government forces had unleashed a toxic chemical bomb against innocent civilians in Khan Sheikhoun in Syria\u2019s Idlib Governate.\n\nIn fact, Parry notes, \u201ca number of intelligence sources have made contradictory assessments, saying the preponderance of evidence suggests that Al Qaeda-affiliated rebels were at fault, either by orchestrating an intentional release of a chemical agent as a provocation or by possessing containers of poison gas that ruptured during a conventional bombing raid.\n\n\u201cOne intelligence source told me that the most likely scenario was a staged event by the rebels intended to force Trump to reverse a policy, announced only days earlier, that the U.S. government would no longer seek \u2018regime change\u2019 in Syria and would focus on attacking the common enemy, Islamic terror groups that represent the core of the rebel forces. \u201cThe source said the Trump national security team split between the President\u2019s close personal advisers, such as nationalist firebrand Steve Bannon and son-in-law Jared Kushner, on one side and old-line neocons who have regrouped under National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, an Army general who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of neocon favorite Gen. David Petraeus.\u201d That split manifested earlier in the removal as national security adviser, Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn, as well as the briefly contentious expulsion of Bannon from the National Security Council \u2014 both ousters, Parry says, fomented establishment neocon influence in Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cThough Bannon and Kushner are often presented as rivals, the source said, they shared the belief that Trump should tell the truth about Syria, revealing the Obama administration\u2019s CIA analysis that a fatal sarin gas attack in 2013 was a \u2018false-flag\u2019 operation intended to sucker President Obama into fully joining the Syrian war on the side of the rebels \u2014 and the intelligence analysts\u2019 similar beliefs about Tuesday\u2019s incident,\u201d he explains. Trump\u2019s decision to proceed with a retaliatory operation, the source continued, came in part as a smoothing of ruffled feathers of hawkish Democrats who have for months bristled about possible collusion between the president\u2019s campaign and, vaguely, Russian officials. Brazenly foregoing congressional approval and the rules of engagement also gleaned long-sought commendation from neocon Republicans previously critical of the president\u2019s foreign policy decisions, including Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. The remainder of support for the brazenly aggressive air assault came from a cadre who viewed Obama\u2019s inability to gain congressional approval and failure to respond militarily to an ostensibly similar chemical attack on Ghouta in 2013, as a show of weakness. Of course, judging by a dearth of evidence and certitude with which the West fingered Assad responsible, Ghouta appeared to constitute a blueprint for the incident at Khan Sheikhoun and all actions in its wake. [Except, this time, Trump jumped the starting gun, raining $110,330,000 in Tomahawks onto an evacuated air base and several innocent victims as \u2018collateral damage\u2019 \u2014 rather, slightly over $43 million, given as few as 23 missiles could be accounted for in the damaged targets on the ground in Syria.] \u201cIn both cases \u2013 2013 and 2017 \u2013 there were strong reasons to doubt Assad\u2019s responsibility,\u201d Parry continues. \u201cIn 2013, he had just invited United Nations inspectors into Syria to investigate cases of alleged rebel use of chemical weapons and thus it made no sense that he would launch a sarin attack in the Damascus suburbs, guaranteeing that the U.N. inspectors would be diverted to that case. \u201cSimilarly, now, Assad\u2019s military has gained a decisive advantage over the rebels and he had just scored a major diplomatic victory with the Trump administration\u2019s announcement that the U.S. was no longer seeking \u2018regime change\u2019 in Syria. The savvy Assad would know that a chemical weapon attack now would likely result in U.S. retaliation and jeopardize the gains that his military has achieved with Russian and Iranian help.\u201d And that has been the question posed by independent journalists and outlets still doggedly committed \u2014 unlike their corporate media counterparts \u2014 to journalism with integrity: What possible benefit would befall Assad for gassing to death his own people \u2014 almost immediately after the U.S. conceded his regime would remain in place? For clarity on what likely took place behind the scenes, former CIA officer Philip Giraldi explained for Scott Horton\u2019s Webcast the Intelligence Community did not give the Assad theory much credence \u2014 and, in fact, aligned more with claims from Moscow and Damascus a conventional Russian airstrike destroyed a cache of chemical weapons belonging to al-Qaeda, which sent poisonous gases downwind to the village. \u201cI\u2019m hearing from sources on the ground in the Middle East, people who are intimately familiar with the intelligence that is available who are saying that the essential narrative that we\u2019re all hearing about the Syrian government or the Russians using chemical weapons on innocent civilians is a sham,\u201d Giraldi asserted. \u201cThe intelligence confirms pretty much the account that the Russians have been giving \u2026 which is that they hit a warehouse where the rebels \u2013 now these are rebels that are, of course, connected with Al Qaeda \u2013 where the rebels were storing chemicals of their own and it basically caused an explosion that resulted in the casualties. Apparently the intelligence on this is very clear.\u201d Subdued tones might have dominated official public statements, but the deviation and distortion of information on the chemical poisoning to pin blame on the Syrian leader ignited such a firestorm of acrimony throughout the Intelligence Community, covert officials were pondering going public. \u201cPeople in both the agency [the CIA] and in the military who are aware of the intelligence are freaking out about this because essentially Trump completely misrepresented what he already should have known \u2013 but maybe he didn\u2019t \u2013 and they\u2019re afraid that this is moving toward a situation that could easily turn into an armed conflict. \u201cThey are astonished by how this is being played by the administration and by the U.S. media.\u201d In the 1997 film, Wag the Dog, a widely disfavored president receives assistance from filmmakers who fabricate a humanitarian crisis out of thin air to deflect attention away from a burgeoning scandal. Even a casual observer can see the justification for Parry\u2019s comparison of the film with Trump\u2019s bizarrely aggressive act. Unfortunately for those already killed and those yet in the path of the U.S.\u2019 humanitarian bombs \u2014 and in contrast to crisis actors portrayed in Wag the Dog \u2014 the decimation and suffering in Syria is not cinema magic of a movie studio\u2019s green screen.
