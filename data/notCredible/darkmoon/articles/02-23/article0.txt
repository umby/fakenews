Having said that, however, I wish to assure you that everything said by the Saker in this interview is an exact quotation taken from two recently published articles by the Saker which you can read in their entirety on <a href=\"http://www.unz.com/tsaker/trump-dreams-vs-trump-reality-hopes-still-permitted/\">The Unz Review</a>\u00a0(bulk of article)\u00a0and on <a href=\"http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/46508.htm\">Information Clearing House</a> (recent update).\u00a0I\u2019ve invented nothing. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"entry-header page-header\"><strong>The reason I\u2019m doing it this way is because the Saker\u2019s original articles are unrelated and somewhat long and diffuse in their totality. I want to cut to the chase and keep it short, with no words wasted. I also wish to add my own views to the mix, giving the impression of a lively and authentic dialogue but in no way falsifying the Saker&#8217;s original narrative. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"entry-header page-header\"><strong>For some time now I&#8217;ve been wondering if the majority of those who voted for Trump did so because they were his enthusiastic fans or simply because they perceived him as the lesser of two evils. What d\u2019you think, Mr Saker?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"entry-header page-header\"><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> Trump was and still is the lesser evil. Please always keep in mind what the alternative was: Hillary Clinton. One of my favorite Russian commentators, Rusian Ostashko, brilliantly put it when he said: \u201cIf Clinton was now sitting in the White House, we Russians would not be discussing the issue of the recognition of Crimea or the future of US sanctions. We would be trying to guess when nuclear war would start, we would be studying our bomb shelter maps.\u201d He is absolutely right, of course.</p>\n<p class=\"entry-header page-header\"><strong>DARKMOON: </strong>So what\u2019s been happening lately that\u2019s got you all excited?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> Something big: the Three Letter Agencies pulled off a\u00a0<em>de facto</em>\u00a0coup against Donald Trump by forcing him to fire his most important foreign policy advisor \u2014 the man who had dared to declare that he wanted to reform the bloated and largely ineffective US intelligence community.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> You\u2019re referring of course to General Flynn\u2019s sudden \u201cresignation\u201d or sacking. Are you concerned about this little setback?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> There is no way of putting a brave face on what happened. Not only because it showed that Trump is not loyal to those who are loyal to him, but because this episode pretty much killed what I would call the \u201cTrump dream\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> I guess, by the \u201cTrump dream\u201d, you mean all the controversial projects and promises Trump set out in his original electoral package, <em>i.e.,\u00a0</em>the big changes his baseline supporters were hoping Trump would introduce \u201cto make America great again\u201d? Like what exactly?</p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> Draining the swamp. Kicking the Neocons down to the basement they crawled out of 24 years ago. Reforming the US intelligence community. Possibly even dissolving the CIA. Or, at the very least, subordinating it to the President.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> What else?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> \u00a0Making peace with Russia. Negotiating a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d which would clearly spell out how the USA and Russia would act towards each other and jointly against common threats. At the very least, this would imply an agreement on the Ukraine and Syria.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> Trump\u2019s enemies are obviously not too keen on his foreign policy. He appears to want peace with Russia. In the eyes of his enemies, I guess this makes him a \u201cRussian agent\u201d and a \u201chigh security risk.\u201d What does Trump need to do to keep his domestic supporters happy?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0 Stop pouring billions of dollars into the Empire and redirect the immense resources currently wasted on war, aggression and subversion back into the United States and their decaying infrastructure, medical care, education, small business. Until now, the main profitable sectors of the US economy were either the military-industrial complex or finance. The hope was that Trump would kick-start the \u201creal\u201d economy: the production of goods and services.</p>\n<p>Law and order would be restored to the USA and the uncontrolled flow of immigrants would finally be regulated. Last, but most definitely not least, Trump would not act on this stupid, counter-productive and self-defeating Iran-bashing and China-bashing rhetoric.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> You believe that none of these noble aims are now likely to see fruition? In other words, the people who voted for Trump are not going to get what they wanted? Is that what you\u2019re saying?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0 For the most part, this dream is now over.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong>\u00a0 So America is . . .</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> On life support.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON: </strong>Okay, so what would you regard here as the main issue? In your opinion, what is the top priority? What does Trump need to do more than anything else?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0 The key, of course, is point one: <em>draining the swamp</em>. In other words, wrestling the power away from the Neocons and the US \u2018deep state\u2019 and putting it back where it belongs: in the hands of a President with a mandate of a majority of the American people.</p>\n<p>That is, alas, the biggest loss we all suffered last week: the man who was supposed to drain the swamp [General Flynn] got a humiliating smack-down by a deep state drunk on its own infinite\u00a0<em>chutzpah</em>. The biggest deal is not that Flynn was sacked, although that is a big deal, but the fact that the deep state forced Trump into publicly betraying Flynn and sacking him instead of those who were involved in this palace coup \u2014 including Pence himself.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON: </strong>What you appear to be saying is deeply disturbing. Few will wish to admit it: namely, that the man selected as President by the American people, after a democratic election, has no power whatsoever to carry out the will of the people. He is no more than a figurehead for more powerful interests. These are the <em>real</em> rulers, and Trump is expected to be their puppet. Unless he agrees meekly to become a proxy for Hillary Clinton, he\u2019ll be out of a job soon, right? \u00a0\u00a0<strong>\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> What the deep state demonstrated this week is that everybody in the Executive Branch serves not at the pleasure of the President, but at the pleasure of the deep state, including probably Donald Trump himself.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON</strong>: You confirm my worst suspicions. Trump must consent to be a lackey for the deep state or else he\u2019s a goner. By the \u201cdeep state\u201d you are obviously referring to elite Jews like the Rothschilds and the tightly knit Jewish groups who control the City of London and set the gold price. Hence your frequent allusions to the \u201canglo-Zionist empire\u201d which you pinpoint as Enemy Number One. \u00a0Your negative references to \u201cneocons\u201d also indicate that you have organized Jewry in mind. The Jewish neocons and their gentile vassals are the main threat to America in your opinion, am I right?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0 I am personally convinced that unless Donald Trump finds in himself the courage to mount a major counter-attack, the neocons will find a way of kicking him out of the White House before his term ends.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong>\u00a0And we all know that \u201cneocons\u201d is a code word for elite Jews and their gentile standard bearers like Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s one thing we know for certain. <em>(Pause) </em>So the beautiful dream is over?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0 Yeah, this is bad. And barring a miracle, the dream is really over.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> I gather you supported Trump initially, and still do, though only as an alternative to the infinitely horrible Hillary. You were never a \u201cTrump dreamer\u201d, were you, like his White Nationalist supporters?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> I never was a \u201cTrump dreamer\u201d. I was merely a Trump *hoper* meaning that I had hopes that Trump would not only be better than Hillary, but that he might deliver on, at least, some of his \u201cdream\u201d message.</p>\n<p>But if the choice is the Neocons humiliating Trump or thermonuclear war \u2013 then I pick the former, with gratitude.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> Small consolation, Mr Saker, if the Anglo-Zionist \u201cparasites\u201d are feeding on the host\u2014and if WE are the host!</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0 It is an undeniable fact that the United States are currently the host upon which the Anglo-Zionist parasite feeds\u2014which this parasite uses to try to subjugate the entire planet.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON: \u00a0</strong>I hope you don\u2019t mind me pointing out that your coded language\u2014in which you refer to \u201cAnglo-Zionist parasites\u201d and an attempt \u201cto subjugate the entire planet\u201d\u2014is straight out of <em>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>. If I\u2019m not mistaken, you are basically referring here to world domination by Jews.</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> What is happening now is that the Neocons and the deep state have succeeded in re-taking control of their host, but only at the cost of a major weakening of that host. The ongoing\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http://www.unz.com/tsaker/a-color-revolution-is-under-way-in-the-united-states/\">color revolution against Trump</a></strong>\u00a0is gutting the power of the American host and, thus, of the Anglo-Zionist parasite.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> A remarkably astute analysis. It takes audacity to say such a thing. Poor America! The blood\u2019s being \u00a0sucked out of it by the parasite that feeds on it! Where next, America?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> In political terms, the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d and \u201cthe city upon the hill\u201d are now the laughingstock of the planet. God only knows where this process might lead us next.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong>\u00a0 A civil war?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0 I, for one, would absolutely not exclude the possibility of civil war in the USA. At this point in time, I am not predicting a civil war in the USA, but I am saying that it has become <em>a real possibility</em>. Civil war or not, all the Neocons and the deep state are doing is accelerating the inevitable collapse of the USA as a world hegemon.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> Can you expand a bit on your view that the problem we are facing is essentially a clash of interests between what Trump wants for America and what the neoconservative elite, the parasites feeding on the host, want for themselves?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0 The big story for the foreseeable future will be the infighting inside the US deep state. Why infighting? Because Trump is also part of the deep state. He did not just suddenly pop out of nowhere, <em>ex nihilo</em>. He had, and still has, powerful backers. That\u2019s the good news.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> And the bad news?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> The bad news is that the faction of the deep state which is backing Trump appears to be the weaker one.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> How much weaker?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> The anti-Trump forces inside the deep state are 70% and the Trump supporters are therefore 30%. \u00a0The infighting between the 70% and the 30% will leave very little energy for either party to deal with Russia, China or Iran. It is a sweet irony that the big proponents of\u00a0<em>divide et impera</em>\u00a0[\u2018divide and rule\u2019] did just that to themselves, is it not?</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:\u00a0 </strong>How sad. So it\u2019s <em>Good-bye, beautiful dream</em>, is it?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> Yes, the \u201cTrump dream\u201d is probably over. It was beautiful as long as it lasted. What happened is really simple. With the election of Trump, the Neocons suffered a crushing defeat and it took them less than a month to regroup and castrate Trump. This is bad and the \u201cTrump dream\u201d is over.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> Are there any parallels here with the Ukraine situation, do you think? Just as they managed to stage a coup against Yanukovich, the democratically elected leader in Ukraine, installing a Jewish puppet in his place, are they trying to do the same to President Trump? Is Trump to be the new Yanukovich?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> Right now, Trump looks like Yanukovich, true. But I think that he is also a far smarter and much more honorable person than Yanukovich. Call me na\u00efve, but my gut feeling is that Trump cares for the USA and that he wants to do the right thing.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> It\u2019s good to hear you say that. I pointed out something very similar in a recent article of my own: \u201cTrump is in deep trouble, it\u2019s touch and go whether he\u2019s going to survive. In other words, he\u2019s a <strong><a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/who-rules-america-donald-trump-or-the-jews/\">good guy drowning</a></strong>.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> I might be wrong about Trump, of course. But at least so far I do not see the clear signs of the total rot and corruption which Yanukovich had all over his face. Furthermore, Trump appears to be learning. That is very important. In\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http://thesaker.is/trump-does-something-right-very-good-press-conference-today/\">his latest press conference,</a></strong>Trump finally showed some real guts and counter-attacked the media. Very effectively I would say. Trump might be a fast learner. And if that is really the case, then he might learn some most useful lessons from the entire Flynn debacle.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> So there are grounds for hope?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0 Hopes are still permitted! Not expectations. Hopes. If the Neocons don\u2019t succeed in impeaching him, Trump might still end up kicking some ass. And if they do impeach him, they will further weaken the Empire.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><em>UPDATE</em></span></h3>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON\u00a0</strong><em>(a few days later) :</em> Events have moved on rapidly since I last spoke with you. It seems you are now far less hopeful than you were. You&#8217;ve done a sudden U-turn. Passing from cautious optimism to bleak pessimism. You now expect Trump to be impeached for treason any time soon. How come?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> \u00a0This is an excerpt from an RT program entitled \u201cWatching the Hawks\u201d. In this excerpt, a \u201cformer\u201d Mossad officer, Juval Aviv, predicts that Donald Trump will be <strong><a href=\"http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/46508.htm\">impeached for treason</a></strong> in the next few months.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong>\u00a0A shocking development, but why should we heed this prediction?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> My experience and gut feeling tells me that this is far from innocent. What I see happening is a preparation for a Trump impeachment on grounds of treason. Here I fully agree with Aviv.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong>\u00a0 So you feel Trump is a goner?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> Whether Trump realizes it or not, he is now fighting for his life. Politically and, probably, literally.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON: \u00a0</strong><em>Literally?</em> You mean he risks assassination?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong>\u00a0He has only days, maybe weeks, to take very strong action. If he continues to take hit after hit after hit and think that good speeches are going to save him, he is absolutely wrong!</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> You&#8217;re suggesting that a coup is imminent, right? But can&#8217;t he get his appointees in the administration to spring to his defense? Pompeo, Mattis, Jeff Sessions, can&#8217;t they rally round him and help to mount a <em>counter-coup</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> Alas, with Flynn Trump <em>really</em> blew it. Flynn, for all his idiosyncrasies and failings, was the kind of man who could have stood by Trump and directed a desperately needed crackdown against the Neocons and their part of the \u2018deep state\u2019. Now he&#8217;s \u00a0left with the very non-political McMaster. Pompeo and Mattis are, at best, useless too. And I am really not impressed by Jeff Sessions who does not strike me as the kind of man who could support, never mind lead, a counter-coup.</p>\n<p>As for the notion that Trump is now leaning on Netanyahu for support \u2013 I see that as a death sentence for Trump.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong> \u00a0So it\u2019s all over for Trump?</p>\n<p><strong>THE SAKER:</strong> I am afraid that the Trump Presidency is on life support.</p>\n<p><strong>DARKMOON:</strong>\u00a0 A sad day for democracy if the 62,979,636 Americans who opted for Trump are to be cheated out of the president they voted for \u2014 and if a Hillary Clinton proxy, which is what the &#8216;deep state&#8217; wants, is foisted upon them. There will be rioting and blood in the streets.</p>\n<p>Allow me to conclude this piece by stating categorically that if the President is impeached and replaced by his Vice President, Mike Pence, which will be the obvious outcome of Trump&#8217;s eviction from the White House, it will be a major catastrophe.</p>\n<p>Why? Because Pence, like Hillary Clinton, appears to be perfect \u00a0blackmail material for the &#8216;deep state&#8217;, with as many skeletons in the cupboard as Hillary Clinton \u2014 if not more. A black shadow hangs over the reputation of Mike Pence, with allegations that Pence is a multiple child rapist and murderer. If there&#8217;s even a whiff of truth in these bizarre allegations, what hope for America? I&#8217;ll leave you to mull over this final quotation:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Vice President Mike Pence\u00a0has been implicated in the pedophile scandal that has the establishment in a panic. According to former CIA\u00a0analyst Robert David Steele, General Michael Flynn was not dismissed for talking to the Russian ambassador and lying about it. He was fired because he had information on a close friend of Pence who is a pedophile. This is consistent with the fact that\u00a0Flynn\u2019s son was also fired\u00a0during the campaign for tweeting about pizzagate. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>More concerning is that Tory Smith has\u00a0a series of youtubes\u00a0accusing Mike Pence of being a multiple child rapist and murderer. Smith, who claimed to be a victim of satanic ritual abuse himself, makes a series of frankly crazy assertions. However, he predicted that Indiana State Police would kill him, and indeed,\u00a0as of July 2016, <a href=\"http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=147455\">he is dead</a>.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>He is dead. </em>How convenient.<i> </i>This does not bode well. If Trump is impeached, only to be replaced by a puppet of the &#8216;deep state&#8217; who happens to be a child raping serial killer, all hell will break loose.

Seems to me that the Deep State, after Trump, would want stability above all else.  They like the status quo, so that they can continue with their war profits, and Trump upended it.  If a Pence child rape scandal takes the place of a Trump impeachment for treason, I can&#8217;t see how serious blood in the streets can be avoided.  It would mean the total victory of the totalitarian Left and the end of America as we know it. </p>\n<p>Btw, I am getting very concerned that Trump loyalists have not yet &#8220;taken it to the streets&#8221; in large numbers to counter the idiocy of the Left.  The Tea Party grew quickly after Obama&#8217;s election to oppose his welfare state agenda.  It helped lead to the Democrats getting murdered at the polls in 2010.  But the stakes were not nearly as high then as now.  If the Trump voters do not get loud and mobilize soon they will lose by forfeit without ever taking the field.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</article><!--

Unless he&#8217;s a total fool, which he is not, he knows when he strikes out against the jew empire, all hell breaks loose and he must have all his ducks, and loyalists, on one page for the initial assault. It is no new secret that many people, myself included, realize that the last battle on earth will be us versus the jews. No doubt whatsoever. Sure, the neocons bleat and blather about Iran, China, Russia, etc, BUT make no mistake about it. We are going to fight the jews, winners take all. It&#8217;s inevitable. We can no longer tolerate having this smothering, smouldering nightmare blocking off our windpipes. We are going to confront this and win, or we will end up on the jew&#8217;s compost heap. All the distractions about the Middle East, blah blah blah, are but mere diversions. We are going to have to do some spring pruning very soon and guess who has to be trimmed? Nice article, Lasha.

Ariadna attacked it a while back.  I was reluctant because I liked hiding behind it, but it is a nonsense-phrase.  For me, Zionism means &#8220;Jewish Global Supremacism&#8221; but in propaganda discourse it just means &#8220;benign Jewish Supremacism in the Levant&#8221; \ud83d\ude09  Thus most readers would probably think that the &#8220;Zionism&#8221; part of &#8220;Anglo-Zionism&#8221; is just referring to a bunch of Israeli-Firsters, which misdirects from the Jewish Global Supremacist aspect  which means control of world culture and finance.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Anglo&#8221; part is just as useless because we all know that the West is controlled by international Jewry (oops another mealy-mouthed phrase \ud83d\ude1b ).  There is no escaping this fact.  So we have a phrase that raises up the influence of the Goy (Anglos) and plays down the dominance of the Jews (Zionist).  Time to dump the Anglo-Zionist moniker.  It might seem to be a useful meme in capturing the truth but it misleads.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947704#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947704\", \"947704\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to Flopot'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947705\" class=\"comment even depth-3\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947705\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6777e23e231c5e2a54fc93aa3d0dde4f?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6777e23e231c5e2a54fc93aa3d0dde4f?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">Sardonicus</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947705\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-23T09:26:59+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 23, 2017 at 9:26 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Well said, Flopot!

But on the other hand, I ask myself things like: Where do the Jews, who are relatively small in number and generally cowardly, get all the cannon fodder to send to Eastern Europe? Where do they get the thousands of people to fill an aircraft carrier to send to the South China sea to try to provoke China? Where do they get all the murderous drone operators? Where do they get all the people working on the assembly lines at places like Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, General Atomics, etc., that are making the missiles and bombs that the Jew-controlled U.S. puppet government uses to murder people all over the world? </p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t these masses of people by now see what&#8217;s going on here?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve come to the realization that if TS ever HTF in the U.S., it won&#8217;t be Jews shooting us down in the streets, it&#8217;ll be our corrupt goy neighbors.</p>\n<p>The robust historical record seems to show that for every Ed Snowden or Chelsea Manning, there are tens of thousands of mentally and morally defective goyim who will gladly and unquestioningly do Jew dirty work even if it means TEOTWAWKI. </p>\n<p>Just as Satan got Eve to destroy herself, the SATANIC Jew always get the goyim to destroy themselves.<br/>\nEve gave Satan an audience and he used the opportunity to &#8220;attack&#8221; her with his lying mouth. I think this is what vampire mythology is trying to teach us about. You invite the vampire into your house and the evil creature attacks you with his mouth. Having been &#8220;beguiled&#8221; (Genesis 3:13), Eve did the dirty work for Satan; all he actually did was to whisper in her ear. Likewise, once &#8220;bitten&#8221; the vampire&#8217;s victims start attacking others; that is, they do the evil creature&#8217;s dirty work. </p>\n<p>Jew controlled America is like a vicious, rabid dog, IMO.

I&#8217;m sticking by my position that the Fed will continue to raise rates throughout this year, and I do believe they will raise again in March. In my view they are establishing a narrative of conflict between the Fed and Trump. As you said, Trump needs lower rates in order to finance his infrastructure program. The Fed won&#8217;t give this to him.</p>\n<p>Consider also that the lefties will likely cheer the Fed because they will assume that higher rates will prevent Trump from funding the border wall.

They are enemies of the Jewish enemy, Iran.</p>\n<p>[In before Pat shows all the connections between Iran and Israel :P]</p>\n<p>Of course, the presence of Goldman Sachs in his cabinet is the biggest red flag because the real engines of Jewish power everywhere are the Central Banking scams, with the Fed being the biggest.

Therefore Jews and spouses of Jews are over-represented among the senior executives of the aforementioned media corporations by a factor of 37 times (3,700 percent). Even the wife of Alex Jones is a Jew.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947736#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947736\", \"947736\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to Jack Harper'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947785\" class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947785\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/20b36b03f7825b67e35642d2b43998da?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/20b36b03f7825b67e35642d2b43998da?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">Ungenius</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947785\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T06:02:51+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 6:02 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>@ Jack Harper</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Trump declared war on the media he effectively and in fact, declared war on the Jews.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thanks for pointing out the obvious which is often overlooked by most because of jewish programing.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947785#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947785\", \"947785\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to Ungenius'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947802\" class=\"comment even depth-2\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947802\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/44949a80a6e3af20b81db86f165130bc?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/44949a80a6e3af20b81db86f165130bc?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">Pat</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947802\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T14:35:41+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 2:35 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Jack &#8211;</p>\n<p>Trump&#8217;s phony rant at the staged press conference has more than doubled viewership at all the major media outlets.</p>\n<p>The Pharisee-Jews knew it and told him they needed more revenues&#8230;!!

She was a Trump supporter back in 2015, when everyone else with a large pen was mocking him.  Her main, just about only, issue is immigration (both legal and illegal).  She gave Trump an A+ thus far, but cautioned that he&#8217;s all alone.  If so, I can&#8217;t see how being all alone is possibly sustainable.  Coulter, IMO, is right on immigration and loves the way, as do I, that Trump dumps all over the Fake News media.  But where is Ann on Russia?  I just scanned her website, which lists all of her articles for the past few years, and did not see even a mention of Russia.  Is Coulter just another Christian Zionist neocon?  If she&#8217;s unwilling to back up her alpha male hero on Russia, which the US Deep State has deliberately turned into an existential crisis, then I&#8217;m afraid that she must be.  Silence is acceptance.  Stopping illegal immigration is important, but nothing is more important than stopping nuclear holocaust.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947737#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947737\", \"947737\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to follyofwar'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947741\" class=\"comment even depth-2\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947741\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a07d03c99b930edda388b426e231ba9?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a07d03c99b930edda388b426e231ba9?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">Gilbert Huntly</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947741\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-23T15:31:00+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 23, 2017 at 3:31 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>While it is good politics to be friendly with Russia, spare yourself the fear of &#8216;nuclear holocaust&#8217; arising from mismanagement.

Their separation means that kikejew factions have not developed a workable total control plan &#8212; and there is even the slight possibility that one of the two may really be fronting for a powerful anti-kikejew entity.</p>\n<p>RESIST !!!</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947755#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947755\", \"947755\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to Bob in DC'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947778\" class=\"comment even depth-2\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947778\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8c46c56b1d83148d0341546e36dbee52?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8c46c56b1d83148d0341546e36dbee52?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">FLAN O\u2019BRIEN</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947778\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T01:50:34+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 1:50 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bob, very interesting about Carter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947778#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947778\", \"947778\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to FLAN O\u2019BRIEN'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n</ol><!-- .children -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947756\" class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947756\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/028c9ed93d3715863a09bb6a468f6cdf?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/028c9ed93d3715863a09bb6a468f6cdf?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\"><a href='http://Conspiracyofman.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Arch Stanton</a></b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947756\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-23T17:38:07+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 23, 2017 at 5:38 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>&#8220;THE SAKER:  For the most part, this dream is now over.&#8221;<br/>\n&#8220;DARKMOON:  So America is . . .&#8221;<br/>\n&#8220;THE SAKER: On life support&#8221;</p>\n<p>This has clearly been the case since the end of the Vietnam war. In fact America&#8217;s rapidly deteriorating condition of the late seventies is what led to my search for what happened to the promise of the &#8220;American dream.&#8221; </p>\n<p>What I cannot comprehend is all this wringing of hands, rending of garments and gnashing of teeth. It&#8217;s like that scorpion story; did America not know what was going on before Trump was elected to ride on its back? Apparently not.</p>\n<p>Observe. The Rothschilds consolidated their European holdings of wealth and power by the late 1700&#8217;s.  By the turn of that century, they virtually owned, and most certainly controlled Britain, the sole &#8220;superpower&#8221; of the day, a global power on whose colonial holdings the &#8220;sun never set.&#8221; </p>\n<p>They also exercised considerable influence over the outcome of the Napoleonic wars that served to strangle the rise of another potential superpower. Rothschild financial power had originally been based in France, but when Napoleon turned on their economic plans for his country, Rothschild money turned Britain against their French foe, ending Napoleon&#8217;s reign at the battle of Waterloo. </p>\n<p>From that point, the Rothschilds played a critical part in fomenting and influencing the American revolution, the war of 1812, the Mexican/American war of 1837 and then the American &#8220;Civil War&#8221; of 1860. </p>\n<p>By this time, the Rothschilds had begun expanding their parasitical power base to the &#8220;new world.&#8221; These wars reflected their emerging interest in America and their gradual abandonment of Britain as their center of power. With Jews it has always been about war, war, war and more war. Since the day Jews fabricated their Torah, it&#8217;s always been about bloody war.  </p>\n<p>By the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds had begun consolidating their control over America. Around the same time, a small portion of their global plan was unveiled by the discovery of the <i>Protocols of the Elders of Zion.</i> A scant twelve years after the new century began, the Rothschild&#8217;s full economic control over America was finally accomplished with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act. Within two years of that act, the world was at war, with America joining in the bloodshed three years after that. The Federal Reserve act was the very same br&#8217;er rabbit scheme replayed with Trump&#8217;s election.</p>\n<p>Jewish economic influence then fomented two of the most murderous wars in history, first one in 1914 and then a second in 1939, a scant quarter of a century after the first major killing campaign. From the very  beginning of the century, brush wars raged throughout the century in places like the Philippines and South America.</p>\n<p>Just after the midpoint of the century&#8217;s global wars came the sixties &#8220;revolution.&#8221; This was a thinly disguised, Jewish, cultural Marxist revolution that served to destroy American culture, reducing it to one of ignorant, stupid, rutting beasts that have now taken over the country to willingly march lock step behind the Jews&#8217; unanimous cry for more warring bloodshed around the planet. </p>\n<p>So there should not be the slightest surprise in finding the world in its present uproar, with war once again on the horizon.  Thanks to the Jews&#8217; destabilizing wars and revolutions, most all the near east has been destabilized and destroyed. The secondary effect of this destruction has been the unrestricted flooding of Europe with immigrants, thereby destabilizing and destroying most of Europe and its different cultures.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Jewish economic control that enabled them to eviscerate American manufacturing and industry, (with a tidy profit to Jewish middle-men) America is now fully dependent on global trade for its survival. America can no longer survive without a constant infusion of foreign trade that is completely controlled by Jewish economic policy; and one man is supposed to reverse all this? </p>\n<p>How can anyone be so naive to believe that any one person, or even a small group, could ever reverse this continuous parade of long standing historical trends that began with the Rothschild&#8217;s accumulation of a major portion of the world&#8217;s wealth? This should be especially obvious considering Jews have all the wealth to fund their agenda while the goyim are left with scant more than angry words. Could this glaring fact be lost on Jews? I think not.</p>\n<p>So why the worry? Why the wonder of it all, when it is quite obvious the world is running straight, narrow and true on rails paid for by Rothschild money? What I see in all this brouhaha is exactly what was to be expected i.e. another Jewish dog and pony show intended to occupy the public while other, far more critical, events pass unnoticed. This is exactly the way Jews have been playing the deception game since the days of the Old Testament when they marched around Jericho singing, shouting and blowing horns to disguise their sappers undermining Jericho&#8217;s fortifying walls.</p>\n<p>Jews pride themselves in their magical acumen. Magicians base their act on deception; look at what this hand is doing so you do not notice what the other hand is doing. This is what is being witnessed in the Trump upset, n&#8217;est-ce pas? So what matter the outcome to Trump and his administration? </p>\n<p>From the beginning of their rise to a global, economic power, the Rothschilds and their Jewish henchmen have been calling the shots like the global criminal mafia they have always been. Whether the world recognizes this and takes action to excise this virulent, diseased parasite or they suffer the terminal consequences of watching the big game on Talmudvision while the world goes up in flames, remains to be seen. However if past performance is an indication of future outcome, then the world is due for a nuclear war. So far, Jews have a better performance record at creating war then a Warren Buffet fund has at creating wealth. Can you say &#8220;one hundred percent&#8221;  boys and girls?   </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that simple, so why confuse the issue, making it any more difficult to understand than what is obviously indicated by the simple facts right before our eyes?</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947756#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947756\", \"947756\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to Arch Stanton'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947758\" class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 parent\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947758\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2be188442dce4b2cacdc101133722554?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2be188442dce4b2cacdc101133722554?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\"><a href='http://deleted' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>kapoore</a></b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947758\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-23T17:59:33+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 23, 2017 at 5:59 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I read half the article and will later finish it. </p>\n<p> I can only say that I am more than a &#8220;hoper&#8221; in Trump; I am a believer in him.  I think he had and has the right instincts.  I don&#8217;t think that Trump will be able to completely get rid of the neocons or the deep state.  How could he go up against a trillion dollar, nihilistic machine.  He can&#8217;t.  But he can bring relief to us.  So, I really hope he just keeps going.  Maybe the Flynn firing was a bad sign&#8230;probably.  I think that the VP is OK.  He is better than Biden but he obviously belongs to the corrupted Republican hierarchy that apparently is rife with blackmailed politicians.  Pence is clogging up the efforts to drain the swamp because it might implicate some of his favorite people.   Pence has that dogmatic Christian goody two shoe quality that is not like free wheeling Trump who is a risk taker in every sense.  Trump instinctively speaks truth to power and he is uneven for sure, probably wreck less.  He says the right thing and then he doesn&#8217;t anticipate the resistance he is facing.  He is weak when it comes to the hyper critical media that is 100% Frankfurt School mind controlled.  He doesn&#8217;t get it.  Unfortunately, he is stupid about Israel.  So, no, he won&#8217;t probably be able to take down the deep state.  But if he can just clean up the bureaucracy like the CDC, the FDA, and take some of the power out of the lobby controlled Congress&#8230;loosen the noose around its neck.   I really hope and pray that he can expose some of the hideous pedophilia and corruption, and free the slaves.   It may, though, cost him his life.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947758#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947758\", \"947758\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to kapoore'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947766\" class=\"comment odd alt depth-2\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947766\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/028c9ed93d3715863a09bb6a468f6cdf?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/028c9ed93d3715863a09bb6a468f6cdf?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\"><a href='http://Conspiracyofman.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Arch Stanton</a></b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947766\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-23T21:20:07+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 23, 2017 at 9:20 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, he is stupid about Israel.&#8221;

I don\u2019t like the name \u201cVineyard of The Saker\u201d, it has negative connotations. But I\u2019m not surprised Lasha is attracted to The Saker, for The Saker is a Falcon and the ancient Egyptian Horus with the One Eye of Horus has The Head of a Falcon, and Lasha has the One Eye of Horus who has the head of a Falcon and \u201cSaker\u201d means \u201cFalcon\u201d and \u201cthe vineyard\u201d of a bird of prey has negative connotations, don\u2019t you think so? Especially as I think us, the readers, is the prey The Falcon-Sakers are after and want to hunt-down and devour. We are but rodents to them, the Sakers, the Falcons, the birds of prey with such keen eyesight they see us, even in the darkest blackest nights with a Darkmoon that is totally black and dark, they see us, their prey. Birds of prey have very good eyesight, and so does the ancient Egyptian \u201cGod\u201d Horus, even though he only has One Eye. Lasha has The One Eye of the Falcon head of ancient Egypt. The Saker is a Falcon. It all leaves one feeling like something not very above-board and not very honest is going on, don\u2019t you think so? Well, Lasha probably doesn\u2019t think so, as Lasha has the head of a Falcon , having the One Eye of Horus and Horus has the head of a Saker, or head of a Falcon, same thing \u201cSaker\u201d and \u201cFalcon\u201d. And it all alludes to ancient Egypt TOO much to place TOO much trust in any of it, as all the CLUES being dropped point to ancient Egypt and to what ancient Egypt symbolizes, ancient Egypt symbolizes Spiritual Bondage. Learn your Catholicism, Oh \u201cCatholic\u201d Sisters, Lasha and Lucy and Monica.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947773#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947773\", \"947773\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to TheRealOriginalJoe'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947799\" class=\"comment even depth-3\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947799\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c39d4a004775dd42f60a260cb4f76c3f?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c39d4a004775dd42f60a260cb4f76c3f?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\"><a href='http://astraeaisabella@wordpress.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Astraea</a></b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947799\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T13:59:58+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 1:59 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I would love to know what you mean by &#8220;ancient Egypt symbolizes Spiritual Bondage&#8221; .

He has the position, authority, the spine, the balls, the intelligence  and belief to go it alone, come what may, knowingly risking his life. This is how all leaders should be. Unfortunately of the many hundreds of national leaders I can only think of two others in this category: Duterte and Putin.   Having attained the summit, they have the self confidence and independence to let rip. It is pathetic that most national leaders are insipid, dumb and weak puppets.</p>\n<p>People go on analysing the political tea leaves but ignore the aura and personality of the man as projected  in his appearances.  Yes he may make some mistakes, eg. Iran, but one of his promises was stopping the foreign wars to no discernible benefit to America. Therefore we can assume that Iran will not mean WWIII whilst Trump is president.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947779#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947779\", \"947779\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to FLAN O\u2019BRIEN'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947781\" class=\"comment even depth-2\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947781\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bdd97282acd726b7370d15c2935d3ab3?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bdd97282acd726b7370d15c2935d3ab3?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\"><a href='http://m.jpost.com/Operation-Protective-Edge/Poll-Over-96-percent-of-Israeli-Jews-do-not-believe-the-IDF-is-using-excessive-force-in-Gaza-369283#article=0OEQ5QjU0MjVDODVFMkI5MTk0RDRFMzYxQzk0N0YyRDk=' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>lobro</a></b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947781\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T03:33:07+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 3:33 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>QED, Flan.<br/>\non a brief Iran note, i file that into the mythical &#8220;embassy in Jerusalem&#8221; drawer, the back of which opens into the garbage chute.<br/>\nit serves a brief diversionary purpose and chucked afterwards &#8211; &#8220;oh sorry, just realized it can&#8217;t be done&#8221;.<br/>\nif trump is so smart, and yes he is, how is he unable to see that iran is russia&#8217;s tightest partner, iranians fighting and dying against jew caliphate in iraq and syria and have never fought a war of conquest?<br/>\nNo, this ruse surely has to deal with temporarily placating jew and saudi, which is jew again.</p>\n<p>Note that Putin organized a n all-islamic conference of religious leaders from all sects and factions, sunni, shia, alawite, etc, and they all agreed and issued a common statement that<br/>\n<b>WAHHABI IS NOT ISLAM</b> (once again, jew in sheep&#8217;s clothing but talented Mr Putin got his eye on the bouncing ball)</p>\n<p>does anyone think that Trump is unaware of this as he prepares to jointly with russians fumigate the viper&#8217;s nest?<br/>\n&#8230; read somewhere that Israel announced that ISIS is not bad at all, ISIS is good &#8230; of course.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947781#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947781\", \"947781\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to lobro'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947822\" class=\"comment byuser comment-author-admin odd alt depth-2\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947822\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c04ef5939f360ca41f9067dec6f285b?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c04ef5939f360ca41f9067dec6f285b?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\"><a href='http://darkmoon.me' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Sister Monica</a></b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947822\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T18:59:10+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 6:59 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>@ Flan O&#8217;Brien</p>\n<p><i>&#8220;The piece by ARCH STANTON is outstanding.&#8221;</i></p>\n<p>I agree.

He is a figure who showed us the possibilities that we, the everyday Americans, might not yet be defeated by the NWO or JWO.   It has manifested strongly among various state politics, where candidates like the gubernatorial hopeful, Corey Stewart, are gaining momentum &#8211; and among other candidate hopefuls, like Marine LePen, in France.   Trump represents an &#8220;awakening&#8221;.   He must see the fruition of it every time he gets an opportunity to scrutinize events and hear opinions.   If I had to explain &#8216;why&#8217; I support him, it would be to castigate those who oppose him for their indefinite and unjustifiable reasoning.   Yes, there are issues pointed out by Pat and Flopot, in this forum, which are, definitely, points which give me pause &#8211; but we should be ever-mindful that God chose not to let KILLARY take the Oval Office, and be thankful.

That is, what if Trump is like the first stage of a rocket, whose purpose is &#8220;liftoff&#8221;, but at some point its fuel is gone and the now useless booster stage is ejected &#8211; as was predetermined before liftoff &#8211; allowing the rocket and the payload it carries to continue on its flight?</p>\n<p>After what happened to JFK, what sincere &#8220;populist&#8221; presidential candidate would want a vice president that&#8217;s far more appealing to the &#8220;deep state&#8221; (i.e., the Jews) than he is? Yet that&#8217;s what our hero seems to have done. Why didn&#8217;t he pick Jesse Ventura or Ron Paul, for example?  In fact he&#8217;s surrounded himself with Jews and establishment warmongers &#8211; the payload &#8211; that wouldn&#8217;t have been too far out of place in a Clinton presidency.  </p>\n<p>So far, our masters have apparently been trying to create the illusion of an embattled &#8220;babe-in-the-woods&#8221; nice guy, hopelessly outnumbered, fighting for his (and our) survival, in the face of relentless attack by an implacable, omnipresent, omnipotent foe.</p>\n<p>And now we&#8217;re hearing things like, &#8220;he&#8217;s not going to last&#8221;; &#8220;he&#8217;ll be impeached&#8221;; &#8220;one of his team is already gone, next it&#8217;ll be him&#8221;; etc.</p>\n<p>What if the Flynn thing was a setup? (After all Trump seemed a little too willing to give up Flynn, in the face of what was really nothing more than an inconsequential legal technicality). What if the whole Trump presidency is a setup, the ultimate &#8220;bait and switch&#8221; scam?</p>\n<p>The situation reminds me of the pre 9/11 psyop, where we were being conditioned for the event with a constant stream of &#8220;warnings&#8221;; e.g., &#8220;Al Qaeda is planning something big&#8221;; &#8220;bin Laden is going to strike&#8221;; &#8220;everything&#8217;s flashing red&#8221;; &#8220;it&#8217;s not a matter of if, but when&#8221;; etc., so that when it actually happened, many of us accepted the official story blaming Osama bin Laden without the presentation of any actual evidence in support.</p>\n<p>Is Trump going to willingly resign at some point, after a crocodile-teary-eyed speech telling &#8220;the people&#8221; how he really tried to do what was right, but his &#8220;deep state&#8221; enemies have made it impossible for him to govern, impossible to deliver on his campaign promises blah-blah-blah? </p>\n<p>Or maybe like Flynn he&#8217;ll be &#8220;caught&#8221; doing something &#8220;bad&#8221; and be &#8220;forced&#8221; do a Richard Nixon type resignation? Or maybe he&#8217;ll develop a sudden health problem from all the stress of fighting the evil &#8220;deep state&#8221; and have to resign for &#8220;health reasons&#8221;?</p>\n<p>Because the Jewish program for world domination and control is at the apparent end stage, where nuclear war is on the table, the Jews need somebody exceptionally evil, i.e., &#8220;demon possessed&#8221;, to hold the office of president. Trump, while no doubt a mendacious, narcissistic, unprincipled scoundrel (IMO), may not be the person they need, except as a temporary place-holder while they get us conditioned for the next phase.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947800#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947800\", \"947800\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to Harold Smith'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947806\" class=\"comment even depth-2 parent\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947806\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/45748f9d0f5770bc22f9c9d4d7972899?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/45748f9d0f5770bc22f9c9d4d7972899?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">follyofwar</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947806\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T14:44:47+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 2:44 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>@Harold Smith &#8211; Good points.  I could never figure out why Trump picked Pence in the first place.  It&#8217;s not like he would have lost Indiana without him.  And did any of the states like PA that went Red for the first time in years only vote Trump because Pence was on the ticket?  Since Pence is a long-time Christian Zionist neocon, if anything he was probably a drag on the ticket.  If he had run on his own, he would have been fighting with Lindsay Graham for the 1%.  I don&#8217;t know about Ventura (although that would have been fascinating), but if Trump had picked Ron Paul (or preferably Rand due to Ron&#8217;s advanced age) his electoral college victory would probably have been even bigger.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947806#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947806\", \"947806\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to follyofwar'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947811\" class=\"comment odd alt depth-3\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947811\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee1d931e619f802fbba4d9e0493c8d69?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ee1d931e619f802fbba4d9e0493c8d69?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">Harold Smith</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947811\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T15:29:36+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 3:29 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>@ Follyofwar</p>\n<p>I forgot to mention the potential psychological impact (especially on the masses of Trump supporters) if he is &#8220;forced&#8221; out in &#8220;defeat&#8221;.

We&#8217;re dealing with a Satanic cult that will cut your throat as soon as look at you.<br/>\nIf JFK had a like-minded person rather than a servile Jew puppet for a vice president, he might not have been assassinated. (BTW IIRC Jews were even calling for Obama&#8217;s assassination at one point during his presidency when he was deemed insufficiently servile).</p>\n<p>I would want the enemy to know that if they get rid of me, it wouldn&#8217;t do them any good, because my like-minded replacement won&#8217;t take orders from them either.</p>\n<p>Second, how do you compromise with &#8220;people&#8221; that really aren&#8217;t even human, IMO? How do you compromise with &#8220;people&#8221; whose every waking moment is treason against the constitution? I see &#8220;people&#8221; like Graham, McCain (and perhaps hundreds of others) as &#8220;the Zodiac killer in a suit and tie&#8221;. These &#8220;people&#8221; are ruthless mass murderers who will gladly help the Jews end life as we know it on this planet. They&#8217;re &#8220;demon possessed&#8221;, IMO.</p>\n<p>Last, why compromise when &#8220;you have them by the ba**s&#8221;?<br/>\nThe president has two very powerful weapons at his disposal: a mandate from the people and the &#8220;bully pulpit&#8221;. The people don&#8217;t want to arm and fund terrorists. The people don&#8217;t want to overthrow other peoples&#8217; governments. The people don&#8217;t want a nuclear war with Russia over the issue of who rules whateveristan, or a nuclear war with China over the Spratley islands. The people don&#8217;t want to squander everything of value, trash the economy and risk nuclear war in the hopeless pursuit of world domination and control.</p>\n<p>Why can&#8217;t Trump address the American people e.g. as follows: &#8220;My fellow Americans, the Obama administration has deployed a missile system in Romania (with another scheduled to be deployed in Poland) which I believe makes us all much less safe. The Russian government sees this deployment as a serious threat, in very much the same way that we saw the deployment of missiles in Cuba as a threat back in 1962. Because you elected me to restore good relations and a spirit of cooperation with Russia and other world powers, it is my intent to remove this missile system from Europe since it serves no legitimate peaceful purpose, and can only cause trouble, possibly even a war.<br/>\nI am addressing you tonight because my efforts to preserve world peace are being opposed by some people in the U.S. senate who do not have our best interests in mind. These people are apparently willing to put you and your families at risk of nuclear war for the sake of world domination and control&#8230;blah&#8230;blah&#8230;blah.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course I believe Trump will never do anything like this because I believe he&#8217;s a fraud.</p>\n<p>I believe this is also the reason why Trump chose a pathetic neocon warmonger for vice president rather than Ron or Rand Paul, Dennis Kucinich, Jesse Ventura, Pat Buchanan, etc. </p>\n<p>As I see it, the Jews have our backs against a wall, and there&#8217;s nothing at all to &#8220;compromise&#8221; about at this point. If Trump is actually for real (which of course I doubt) and he tries to out-Jew the Jews rather than stand on principle, he will fail spectacularly, IMO.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947837\" class=\"comment even depth-3\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947837\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/44949a80a6e3af20b81db86f165130bc?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/44949a80a6e3af20b81db86f165130bc?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">Pat</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947837\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-25T04:33:59+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 25, 2017 at 4:33 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Lobro &#8211;</p>\n<p>The candidates &#8216;pick&#8217; running mates because the states and the PRIVATE political parties &#8211; all PRIVATE CORPORATIONS &#8211;  decided arbitrarily to disregard the US Constitution in the election process.</p>\n<p>The lawful election system has been badly broken for well  over 160 years.<br/>\n<strong>The whole process is fraudulent&#8230;.!!</strong> \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>The practice of running candidates for president and vice president together evolved in the nineteenth century. Originally, electors cast two ballots for president and whoever took second place in the tabulation became vice president. </p>\n<p>Starting in 1804, the president and vice president were elected on separate ballots as specified in the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution which was adopted in that year. </p>\n<p><strong>As more and more states subsequently began to choose their electors by popular election instead of appointment (South Carolina being the last state to change, in 1860), candidates began to realize they could run together as a team for president and vice president instead of running completely separately for each office.</strong></p>\n<p>The practice of a presidential candidate having a running mate was solidified during the American Civil War. In 1864, in the interest of fostering national unity, Abraham Lincoln from the Republican Party (popular in the North) and Andrew Johnson of the Democratic Party (popular in the South), were co-endorsed and run together for President and Vice-President as candidates of the National Union Party. </p>\n<p>After that&#8230; the <strong>STATES BEGAN to place candidates for President and Vice-President together on the same ballot ticket &#8211; thus making it impossible to vote for a presidential candidate from one party and a vice-presidential candidate from another party, as had previously been possible.</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947839\" class=\"comment odd alt depth-3\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947839\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/20b36b03f7825b67e35642d2b43998da?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/20b36b03f7825b67e35642d2b43998da?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">Ungenius</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947839\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-25T05:53:16+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 25, 2017 at 5:53 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>@ Lobro</p>\n<p>\u201cthis is the hardest job in the world, bar none, Hitler and Putin had it easy by comparison.<br/>\nAnd Trump has been perfect so far, the man is a legitimate genius, even if they get him in the end.\u201d</p>\n<p>Very well said and true.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947869\" class=\"comment even depth-3\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947869\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/44949a80a6e3af20b81db86f165130bc?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/44949a80a6e3af20b81db86f165130bc?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">Pat</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947869\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-25T15:43:38+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 25, 2017 at 3:43 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Lobro &#8211;</p>\n<p>Political parties are Private Corporations&#8230;

He was always on the sidelines looking on, he never cared deeply enough to put any blood on the street.    </p>\n<p>The true deplorables will never give up the dream because they can&#8217;t afford to.  They are the mothers with a vaccine injured child who will continue to fight no matter how many doctors and specialists tell her to accept her fate.  Or the mother that lost her child when a corrupt CPS decided she was unfit because she was homeschooling or because she wouldn&#8217;t administer this or that medicine.    It&#8217;s strange how the fakery of Hillary Clinton making &#8220;HER&#8221; the center of the campaign mimics the real rise of the feminine.   Many may laugh at me but I see Donald Trump as a kind of knight of chivalry that rises up to fight the forces of darkness, and yet always he is fighting for the Lady, not just the beautiful Lady of his heart&#8217;s desire but the Our Lady, the compassionate and loving side of God.  Hillary pretended to care about children but she never saw the tragedy of a mother losing her child, and Donald Trump did.  So, the dreams and hopes of the sick and injured are on Donald Trump and if he fails us then we will still not give up.  But I don&#8217;t think he will fail us.   The rise of the fake feminine, the feminists, will fail; but  the rise of the true feminine will replace it and succeed.     All those people shoved under the rug are not like snowflakes, we will not melt and go away so easily.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947821#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947821\", \"947821\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to kapoore'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947825\" class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947825\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/44949a80a6e3af20b81db86f165130bc?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/44949a80a6e3af20b81db86f165130bc?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">Pat</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947825\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T19:21:12+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 7:21 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Trump cannot change the stereotype of America&#8230; set in the 60s and 70s&#8230;!!</p>\n<p>In 1971 We Knew\u2026<br/>\n<strong>\u201cAmerican Woman\u201d = \u2019Statue of Liberty\u2019</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/8o0SUJQOrGA?t=219\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/8o0SUJQOrGA?t=219</a> </p>\n<p>American woman, said get away<br/>\nAmerican woman, listen what I say<br/>\nDon&#8217;t come a hangin&#8217; around my door<br/>\nDon&#8217;t want to see your face no more</p>\n<p><strong>I don&#8217;t need your war machines<br/>\nI don&#8217;t need your ghetto scenes</strong></p>\n<p>Colored lights can hypnotize<br/>\nSparkle someone else&#8217;s eyes<br/>\nNow woman, get away from me<br/>\nAmerican woman, mama let me be</p>\n<p>.. </p>\n<p>NOW\u2026.

I don&#8217;t think, though,  that the mother instinct can be extinguished by pop culture.  As is said, and often repeated, before there were doctors there were mothers.  Mothers have assured the survival  of the species for hundreds of thousands of years.  Pieces of the child&#8217;s DNA remain in the mother and so in a biological as well as a psychological sense the mother is attached to her child.  It&#8217;s the same in monkeys of course.  But in humans we call it the divine feminine and it has nothing to do with the the masonic tourist attraction, I mean the statue of liberty,   Mothers never stop praying for their children.  I can see  you like the  raunchy archetype, and I guess we all do, but the archetypal mother is far more fierce like a mother bear and her cub&#8211;don&#8217;t ever get between every hiker knows&#8230;  The neoliberal in their ignorance of the natural are about to get clawed.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\"><a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/?replytocom=947828#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( \"div-comment-947828\", \"947828\", \"respond\", \"60683\" )' aria-label='Reply to kapoore'>Reply</a></div>\t\t\t</article><!-- .comment-body -->\n<ol class=\"children\">\n\t\t<li id=\"comment-947830\" class=\"comment even depth-2 parent\">\n\t\t\t<article id=\"div-comment-947830\" class=\"comment-body\">\n\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"comment-meta\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/45748f9d0f5770bc22f9c9d4d7972899?s=60&#038;d=mm&#038;r=pg' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/45748f9d0f5770bc22f9c9d4d7972899?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=pg 2x' class='avatar avatar-60 photo' height='60' width='60'/>\t\t\t\t\t\t<b class=\"fn\">follyofwar</b> <span class=\"says\">says:</span>\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-author -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-metadata\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.darkmoon.me/2017/trump-to-be-impeached-for-treason-an-interview-with-the-saker/#comment-947830\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime=\"2017-02-24T23:03:23+00:00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2017 at 11:03 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .comment-metadata -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"comment-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Kapoore:<br/>\nThe mama bear instinct to protect her cubs has been programmed out of the majority of the women of the USA.

We should not stop by just questioning the efficacy of vaccines, but also include the everlasting psychological trauma of male genital mutilation.  In my opinion, the Jews have pulled a fast one on we stupid gentiles by claiming that non-consenting male genital mutilation has health benefits.

Mothers, shouldn&#8217;t let their  babies out of  their sight!!   The problem is that  women  don&#8217;t trust their instincts and give in to the authoritarian hospital staff and doctors who do not often have their best interests in mind.  This is an example of how ugly modern America has become that we have so little respect for mothers that we take advantage while giving birth.  </p>\n<p> Woman are encouraged to break through  the glass ceiling, but what women really need is someone to break up the  medical dictatorship that  breaks women&#8217;s hearts by destroying their children.   The glass ceiling means nothing really.  Very few women would trade a high executive position for the life and health of their child.

MONTECRISTO: This interview with \u2018The Saker\u2019 never took place. But as Lasha Darkmoon explains, every word spoken by the Saker here is an exact quote from the Saker\u2019s own writings.\n\n\u201cThe Trump dream is probably over.\n\nIt was beautiful while it lasted.\u201d \u2014 The Saker\n\nLASHA DARKMOON: I\u2019ll begin by revealing that I\u2019ve never actually met \u2018The Saker\u2019 or even corresponded with him, so obviously this is an imaginary interview. Having said that, however, I wish to assure you that everything said by the Saker in this interview is an exact quotation taken from two recently published articles by the Saker which you can read in their entirety on The Unz Review (bulk of article) and on Information Clearing House (recent update). I\u2019ve invented nothing.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m doing it this way is because the Saker\u2019s original articles are unrelated and somewhat long and diffuse in their totality. I want to cut to the chase and keep it short, with no words wasted. I also wish to add my own views to the mix, giving the impression of a lively and authentic dialogue but in no way falsifying the Saker\u2019s original narrative.\n\nFor some time now I\u2019ve been wondering if the majority of those who voted for Trump did so because they were his enthusiastic fans or simply because they perceived him as the lesser of two evils. What d\u2019you think, Mr Saker?\n\nTHE SAKER: Trump was and still is the lesser evil. Please always keep in mind what the alternative was: Hillary Clinton. One of my favorite Russian commentators, Rusian Ostashko, brilliantly put it when he said: \u201cIf Clinton was now sitting in the White House, we Russians would not be discussing the issue of the recognition of Crimea or the future of US sanctions. We would be trying to guess when nuclear war would start, we would be studying our bomb shelter maps.\u201d He is absolutely right, of course.\n\nDARKMOON: So what\u2019s been happening lately that\u2019s got you all excited?\n\nTHE SAKER: Something big: the Three Letter Agencies pulled off a de facto coup against Donald Trump by forcing him to fire his most important foreign policy advisor \u2014 the man who had dared to declare that he wanted to reform the bloated and largely ineffective US intelligence community.\n\nDARKMOON: You\u2019re referring of course to General Flynn\u2019s sudden \u201cresignation\u201d or sacking. Are you concerned about this little setback?\n\nTHE SAKER: There is no way of putting a brave face on what happened. Not only because it showed that Trump is not loyal to those who are loyal to him, but because this episode pretty much killed what I would call the \u201cTrump dream\u201d.\n\nDARKMOON: I guess, by the \u201cTrump dream\u201d, you mean all the controversial projects and promises Trump set out in his original electoral package, i.e., the big changes his baseline supporters were hoping Trump would introduce \u201cto make America great again\u201d? Like what exactly?\n\nTHE SAKER: Draining the swamp. Kicking the Neocons down to the basement they crawled out of 24 years ago. Reforming the US intelligence community. Possibly even dissolving the CIA. Or, at the very least, subordinating it to the President.\n\nDARKMOON: What else?\n\nTHE SAKER: Making peace with Russia. Negotiating a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d which would clearly spell out how the USA and Russia would act towards each other and jointly against common threats. At the very least, this would imply an agreement on the Ukraine and Syria.\n\nDARKMOON: Trump\u2019s enemies are obviously not too keen on his foreign policy. He appears to want peace with Russia. In the eyes of his enemies, I guess this makes him a \u201cRussian agent\u201d and a \u201chigh security risk.\u201d What does Trump need to do to keep his domestic supporters happy?\n\nTHE SAKER: Stop pouring billions of dollars into the Empire and redirect the immense resources currently wasted on war, aggression and subversion back into the United States and their decaying infrastructure, medical care, education, small business. Until now, the main profitable sectors of the US economy were either the military-industrial complex or finance. The hope was that Trump would kick-start the \u201creal\u201d economy: the production of goods and services.\n\nLaw and order would be restored to the USA and the uncontrolled flow of immigrants would finally be regulated. Last, but most definitely not least, Trump would not act on this stupid, counter-productive and self-defeating Iran-bashing and China-bashing rhetoric.\n\nDARKMOON: You believe that none of these noble aims are now likely to see fruition? In other words, the people who voted for Trump are not going to get what they wanted? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\n\nTHE SAKER: For the most part, this dream is now over.\n\nDARKMOON: So America is . . .\n\nTHE SAKER: On life support.\n\nDARKMOON: Okay, so what would you regard here as the main issue? In your opinion, what is the top priority? What does Trump need to do more than anything else?\n\nTHE SAKER: The key, of course, is point one: draining the swamp. In other words, wrestling the power away from the Neocons and the US \u2018deep state\u2019 and putting it back where it belongs: in the hands of a President with a mandate of a majority of the American people.\n\nThat is, alas, the biggest loss we all suffered last week: the man who was supposed to drain the swamp [General Flynn] got a humiliating smack-down by a deep state drunk on its own infinite chutzpah. The biggest deal is not that Flynn was sacked, although that is a big deal, but the fact that the deep state forced Trump into publicly betraying Flynn and sacking him instead of those who were involved in this palace coup \u2014 including Pence himself.\n\nDARKMOON: What you appear to be saying is deeply disturbing. Few will wish to admit it: namely, that the man selected as President by the American people, after a democratic election, has no power whatsoever to carry out the will of the people. He is no more than a figurehead for more powerful interests. These are the real rulers, and Trump is expected to be their puppet. Unless he agrees meekly to become a proxy for Hillary Clinton, he\u2019ll be out of a job soon, right?\n\nTHE SAKER: What the deep state demonstrated this week is that everybody in the Executive Branch serves not at the pleasure of the President, but at the pleasure of the deep state, including probably Donald Trump himself.\n\nDARKMOON: You confirm my worst suspicions. Trump must consent to be a lackey for the deep state or else he\u2019s a goner. By the \u201cdeep state\u201d you are obviously referring to elite Jews like the Rothschilds and the tightly knit Jewish groups who control the City of London and set the gold price. Hence your frequent allusions to the \u201canglo-Zionist empire\u201d which you pinpoint as Enemy Number One. Your negative references to \u201cneocons\u201d also indicate that you have organized Jewry in mind. The Jewish neocons and their gentile vassals are the main threat to America in your opinion, am I right?\n\nTHE SAKER: I am personally convinced that unless Donald Trump finds in himself the courage to mount a major counter-attack, the neocons will find a way of kicking him out of the White House before his term ends.\n\nDARKMOON: And we all know that \u201cneocons\u201d is a code word for elite Jews and their gentile standard bearers like Hillary Clinton. That\u2019s one thing we know for certain. (Pause) So the beautiful dream is over?\n\nTHE SAKER: Yeah, this is bad. And barring a miracle, the dream is really over.\n\nDARKMOON: I gather you supported Trump initially, and still do, though only as an alternative to the infinitely horrible Hillary. You were never a \u201cTrump dreamer\u201d, were you, like his White Nationalist supporters?\n\nTHE SAKER: I never was a \u201cTrump dreamer\u201d. I was merely a Trump *hoper* meaning that I had hopes that Trump would not only be better than Hillary, but that he might deliver on, at least, some of his \u201cdream\u201d message.\n\nBut if the choice is the Neocons humiliating Trump or thermonuclear war \u2013 then I pick the former, with gratitude.\n\nDARKMOON: Small consolation, Mr Saker, if the Anglo-Zionist \u201cparasites\u201d are feeding on the host\u2014and if WE are the host!\n\nTHE SAKER: It is an undeniable fact that the United States are currently the host upon which the Anglo-Zionist parasite feeds\u2014which this parasite uses to try to subjugate the entire planet.\n\nDARKMOON: I hope you don\u2019t mind me pointing out that your coded language\u2014in which you refer to \u201cAnglo-Zionist parasites\u201d and an attempt \u201cto subjugate the entire planet\u201d\u2014is straight out of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. If I\u2019m not mistaken, you are basically referring here to world domination by Jews.\n\nTHE SAKER: What is happening now is that the Neocons and the deep state have succeeded in re-taking control of their host, but only at the cost of a major weakening of that host. The ongoing color revolution against Trump is gutting the power of the American host and, thus, of the Anglo-Zionist parasite.\n\nDARKMOON: A remarkably astute analysis. It takes audacity to say such a thing. Poor America! The blood\u2019s being sucked out of it by the parasite that feeds on it! Where next, America?\n\nTHE SAKER: In political terms, the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d and \u201cthe city upon the hill\u201d are now the laughingstock of the planet. God only knows where this process might lead us next.\n\nDARKMOON: A civil war?\n\nTHE SAKER: I, for one, would absolutely not exclude the possibility of civil war in the USA. At this point in time, I am not predicting a civil war in the USA, but I am saying that it has become a real possibility. Civil war or not, all the Neocons and the deep state are doing is accelerating the inevitable collapse of the USA as a world hegemon.\n\nDARKMOON: Can you expand a bit on your view that the problem we are facing is essentially a clash of interests between what Trump wants for America and what the neoconservative elite, the parasites feeding on the host, want for themselves?\n\nTHE SAKER: The big story for the foreseeable future will be the infighting inside the US deep state. Why infighting? Because Trump is also part of the deep state. He did not just suddenly pop out of nowhere, ex nihilo. He had, and still has, powerful backers. That\u2019s the good news.\n\nDARKMOON: And the bad news?\n\nTHE SAKER: The bad news is that the faction of the deep state which is backing Trump appears to be the weaker one.\n\nDARKMOON: How much weaker?\n\nTHE SAKER: The anti-Trump forces inside the deep state are 70% and the Trump supporters are therefore 30%. The infighting between the 70% and the 30% will leave very little energy for either party to deal with Russia, China or Iran. It is a sweet irony that the big proponents of divide et impera [\u2018divide and rule\u2019] did just that to themselves, is it not?\n\nDARKMOON: How sad. So it\u2019s Good-bye, beautiful dream, is it?\n\nTHE SAKER: Yes, the \u201cTrump dream\u201d is probably over. It was beautiful as long as it lasted. What happened is really simple. With the election of Trump, the Neocons suffered a crushing defeat and it took them less than a month to regroup and castrate Trump. This is bad and the \u201cTrump dream\u201d is over.\n\nDARKMOON: Are there any parallels here with the Ukraine situation, do you think? Just as they managed to stage a coup against Yanukovich, the democratically elected leader in Ukraine, installing a Jewish puppet in his place, are they trying to do the same to President Trump? Is Trump to be the new Yanukovich?\n\nTHE SAKER: Right now, Trump looks like Yanukovich, true. But I think that he is also a far smarter and much more honorable person than Yanukovich. Call me na\u00efve, but my gut feeling is that Trump cares for the USA and that he wants to do the right thing.\n\nDARKMOON: It\u2019s good to hear you say that. I pointed out something very similar in a recent article of my own: \u201cTrump is in deep trouble, it\u2019s touch and go whether he\u2019s going to survive. In other words, he\u2019s a good guy drowning.\u201d\n\nTHE SAKER: I might be wrong about Trump, of course. But at least so far I do not see the clear signs of the total rot and corruption which Yanukovich had all over his face. Furthermore, Trump appears to be learning. That is very important. In his latest press conference,Trump finally showed some real guts and counter-attacked the media. Very effectively I would say. Trump might be a fast learner. And if that is really the case, then he might learn some most useful lessons from the entire Flynn debacle.\n\nDARKMOON: So there are grounds for hope?\n\nTHE SAKER: Hopes are still permitted! Not expectations. Hopes. If the Neocons don\u2019t succeed in impeaching him, Trump might still end up kicking some ass. And if they do impeach him, they will further weaken the Empire.\n\nUPDATE\n\nDARKMOON (a few days later) : Events have moved on rapidly since I last spoke with you. It seems you are now far less hopeful than you were. You\u2019ve done a sudden U-turn. Passing from cautious optimism to bleak pessimism. You now expect Trump to be impeached for treason any time soon. How come?\n\nTHE SAKER: This is an excerpt from an RT program entitled \u201cWatching the Hawks\u201d. In this excerpt, a \u201cformer\u201d Mossad officer, Juval Aviv, predicts that Donald Trump will be impeached for treason in the next few months.\n\nDARKMOON: A shocking development, but why should we heed this prediction?\n\nTHE SAKER: My experience and gut feeling tells me that this is far from innocent. What I see happening is a preparation for a Trump impeachment on grounds of treason. Here I fully agree with Aviv.\n\nDARKMOON: So you feel Trump is a goner?\n\nTHE SAKER: Whether Trump realizes it or not, he is now fighting for his life. Politically and, probably, literally.\n\nDARKMOON: Literally? You mean he risks assassination?\n\nTHE SAKER: He has only days, maybe weeks, to take very strong action. If he continues to take hit after hit after hit and think that good speeches are going to save him, he is absolutely wrong!\n\nDARKMOON: You\u2019re suggesting that a coup is imminent, right? But can\u2019t he get his appointees in the administration to spring to his defense? Pompeo, Mattis, Jeff Sessions, can\u2019t they rally round him and help to mount a counter-coup?\n\nTHE SAKER: Alas, with Flynn Trump really blew it. Flynn, for all his idiosyncrasies and failings, was the kind of man who could have stood by Trump and directed a desperately needed crackdown against the Neocons and their part of the \u2018deep state\u2019. Now he\u2019s left with the very non-political McMaster. Pompeo and Mattis are, at best, useless too. And I am really not impressed by Jeff Sessions who does not strike me as the kind of man who could support, never mind lead, a counter-coup.\n\nAs for the notion that Trump is now leaning on Netanyahu for support \u2013 I see that as a death sentence for Trump.\n\nDARKMOON: So it\u2019s all over for Trump?\n\nTHE SAKER: I am afraid that the Trump Presidency is on life support.\n\nDARKMOON: A sad day for democracy if the 62,979,636 Americans who opted for Trump are to be cheated out of the president they voted for \u2014 and if a Hillary Clinton proxy, which is what the \u2018deep state\u2019 wants, is foisted upon them. There will be rioting and blood in the streets.\n\nAllow me to conclude this piece by stating categorically that if the President is impeached and replaced by his Vice President, Mike Pence, which will be the obvious outcome of Trump\u2019s eviction from the White House, it will be a major catastrophe.\n\nWhy? Because Pence, like Hillary Clinton, appears to be perfect blackmail material for the \u2018deep state\u2019, with as many skeletons in the cupboard as Hillary Clinton \u2014 if not more. A black shadow hangs over the reputation of Mike Pence, with allegations that Pence is a multiple child rapist and murderer. If there\u2019s even a whiff of truth in these bizarre allegations, what hope for America? I\u2019ll leave you to mull over this final quotation:\n\nVice President Mike Pence has been implicated in the pedophile scandal that has the establishment in a panic. According to former CIA analyst Robert David Steele, General Michael Flynn was not dismissed for talking to the Russian ambassador and lying about it. He was fired because he had information on a close friend of Pence who is a pedophile. This is consistent with the fact that Flynn\u2019s son was also fired during the campaign for tweeting about pizzagate. More concerning is that Tory Smith has a series of youtubes accusing Mike Pence of being a multiple child rapist and murderer. Smith, who claimed to be a victim of satanic ritual abuse himself, makes a series of frankly crazy assertions. However, he predicted that Indiana State Police would kill him, and indeed, as of July 2016, he is dead.\n\nHe is dead. How convenient. This does not bode well. If Trump is impeached, only to be replaced by a puppet of the \u2018deep state\u2019 who happens to be a child raping serial killer, all hell will break loose.
