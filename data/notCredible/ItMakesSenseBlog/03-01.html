          <p>President Trump addressed both houses of Congress in a Joint Session just over a month into his presidency<br />
New U.S. leader channeled Kennedy to speak of the &#8216;courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts&#8217;<br />
But bluntly political speech also tells the House and the Senate to take action on his agenda<br />
He told them to &#8216;increase funding for our veterans,&#8217; pass &#8216;historic tax reform&#8217;, &#8216;repeal and replace Obamacare,&#8217; and &#8216;help ensure new parents have paid family leave&#8217;<br />
Most electrifying moment of address lasting slightly over one hour was when he paid tribute to William &#8216;Ryan&#8217; Owens, SEAL killed on raid in Yemen last month<br />
The SEAL&#8217;s widow Carryn Owens sat beside Ivanka Trump and cried as the divided Congress united for the longest ovation of the evening<br />
Trump refused to back down on immigration saying: &#8216;what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one?&#8217;<br />
Opening sentences of speech robustly condemned anti-Semitic attacks and allegedly racially motivated Kansas City shooting of two Indian men<br />
Democratic women wore white in reference to fight for suffrage and made thumbs down gestures to speech</p>
<p>by David Martosko</p>
<p>President Donald Trump took his first mission-critical trip down Pennsylvania Avenue on Tuesday to address a Joint Session of Congress, telling his political opponents that &#8216;the time for small thinking is over, the time for trivial fights is behind us.&#8217;<br />
At that very moment, a member of the Democratic Party hissed.<br />
But Trump&#8217;s 60-minute speech drew 94 interruptions for applause, including a sustained, tear-jerking ovation for the widow of a Navy SEAL killed in action just eight days after Trump took office.<br />
As Carryn Owens wept and Ivanka Trump comforted her, Trump said her husband Ryan was happy that the lengthy applause &#8216;broke a record.&#8217;<br />
The slain sailor&#8217;s father made headlines last week when he said he had refused to speak with the president when his son&#8217;s remains were returned to the U.S. in a somber ceremony. He also blasted Trump for green-lighting what he called the &#8216;stupid mission&#8217; that claimed Ryan&#8217;s life.<br />
But the president praised Ryan as &#8216;a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;Ryan&#8217;s legacy is etched into eternity&#8217; Trump said. &#8216;For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one&#8217;s life for one&#8217;s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom. We will never forget Ryan.&#8217;<br />
Trump began Tuesday night with a claim on the role of political peacemaker, saying he wanted to bring Americans who voted for him together with those who didn&#8217;t.<br />
&#8216;I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart,&#8217; he said.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-53737" src="http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2017/03/3DD2E17A00000578-4269814-image-m-112_1488335530950-550x363.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="363" srcset="http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2017/03/3DD2E17A00000578-4269814-image-m-112_1488335530950-550x363.jpg 550w, http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2017/03/3DD2E17A00000578-4269814-image-m-112_1488335530950-300x198.jpg 300w, http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2017/03/3DD2E17A00000578-4269814-image-m-112_1488335530950-768x507.jpg 768w, http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2017/03/3DD2E17A00000578-4269814-image-m-112_1488335530950.jpg 962w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p>That followed a stunning condemnation of anti-Semitism and other hatred.<br />
Trump declared that the close of Black History Month led him to remember &#8216;our nation&#8217;s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.&#8217;<br />
Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week&#8217;s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.<br />

&#8216;Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week&#8217;s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.&#8217;<br />
Some of Trump&#8217;s other rhetoric was full of hopeful Kennedyesque loft – notable after four contentious weeks marking the beginning of the president&#8217;s Washington odyssey.<br />
&#8216;Think of the marvels we can achieve,&#8217; Trump urged, speaking of his still-incubating science reform proposals, &#8216;if we simply set free the dreams of our people, cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.&#8217;<br />
Trump, 70, was predicting a safer and more prosperous world when America celebrates its 250th birthday in 2026. He noted the centennial celebrations in 1876 where &#8216;the country&#8217;s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations&#8217; in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>DEMOCRATS LAUGHED, HISSED AND GASPED</strong><br />
Trump made appeal after appeal for bipartisan cooperation, but Democrats were anything but unanimously receptive.<br />
SEAL HERO PRAISED<br />
Ryan&#8217;s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one&#8217;s life for one&#8217;s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom. We will never forget Ryan.<br />
Trump, paying tribute to Ryan Owens, a Navy SEAL who perished in a military operation late last month<br />
Some of them laughed out loud when the president bragged that he has &#8216;begun to drain the swamp of government corruption.&#8217;<br />
Others gasped in audible disbelief when he announced the formation of a government department to assist victims of illegal-immigrant criminals.<br />
Then came the hissing when he announced that &#8216;the time for trivial fights is behind us.&#8217;<br />
Democrats sat, arms folded, as he rattled off a laundry list of his supporters&#8217; red meat slogans – all with the usual panache.<br />
&#8216;We will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border,&#8217; he said. &#8216;It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.&#8217;<br />
And he doubled down on efforts to pause admissions to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority nations where limited screening capacity has left question marks next to countless incoming travelers.<br />
&#8216;It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur,&#8217; he said.<br />
Democrats have already pilloried Trump through days of tumult as his White House endured an error-ridden rollout of his travel ban order.<br />
They descended into Schadenfreude as the investigative saga of his campaign&#8217;s alleged Moscow ties took on new and ever more threatening forms.<br />
They mocked the Trump administration&#8217;s leak-prone inner circle. They obstructed the confirmation calendar of his cabinet secretaries.<br />
They clobbered the first outline of the president&#8217;s budget priorities.<br />
They were joined in that by some key Republicans.</p>

<p>RED MEAT ON ISIS AND IMMIGRATION<br />
On Tuesday they joined the GOP in applauding Trump&#8217;s condemnation of the ISIS terror army as &#8216;a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.&#8217;<br />
There was no such bipartisan appreciation when the president boomed the words &#8216;radical Islamic terrorism.&#8217;<br />
The degree to which Trump has polarized Washington could be seen on the faces of lawmakers, and in the reactions of TV hosts Joe Scarborough and Sean Hannity. Both men were guests of congressmen.<br />
Hannity, a Fox News conservative, applauded and roared as Trump outlined his agenda. MSNBC&#8217;s Scarborough, a former Republican congressman who now mocks the White House daily, scowled and shook his head.<br />
Trump began Tuesday night with a claim on the role of political peacemaker, saying he wanted to bring Americans who voted for him together with those who didn&#8217;t<br />

Trump began Tuesday night with a claim on the role of political peacemaker, saying he wanted to bring Americans who voted for him together with those who didn&#8217;t<br />
Trump called on Tuesday for Congress to &#8216;increase funding for our veterans,&#8217; pass &#8216;historic tax reform&#8217; for middle-class Americans, make good on his campaign pledge to &#8216;repeal and replace Obamacare,&#8217; help soften the financial burden of child care, and &#8216;help ensure new parents have paid family leave.&#8217;<br />
His speech also included a demand that the government &#8216;invest in women&#8217;s health&#8217; and &#8216;promote clean air and clean water and rebuild our military infrastructure.&#8217;<br />
And Trump boasted that &#8216;by finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.&#8217;<br />
Trump&#8217;s domestic policy prescriptions were led by his death prognosis for the Obamacare medical insurance overhaul experiment.<br />
&#8216;Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do,&#8217; he pledged.<br />
&#8216;Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken.&#8217;<br />
Trump said he will support retaining one aspect of the Affordable Care Act, ensuring that patients with pre-existing medical conditions can&#8217;t be denied insurance coverage.<br />
He also demanded &#8216;a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>NO BACKING DOWN: SCHOOL CHOICE AND DEPORTATIONS</strong><br />
The president challenged Congress to develop a plan that will use tax credits and &#8216;Health Savings Accounts&#8217; to give Americans a broader choice of plans – including those offered by insurance companies in other states.<br />
Trump also planted a stake in the ground for school-choice advocates, saying that &#8216;education is the civil rights issue of our time.&#8217;<br />
He asked Congress for an education bill &#8216;that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them,&#8217; he said.<br />
Another dramatic moment came when he acknowledged Jamiel Shaw, the father of a 17-year-old boy who was &#8216;viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.&#8217;<br />
Shaw, along with a group of &#8216;Angel Moms&#8217; who lost children in similar attacks, was a fixture at Trump campaign rallies.<br />
Next to him sat the widows of two police officers &#8216;gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.&#8217;<br />
The central philosophy of the president&#8217;s economic and foreign policies is the &#8216;America first&#8217; agenda he promised would guide him in his inauguration speech.</p>
<p><strong>SOLVE PROBLEMS AT HOME FIRST</strong><br />
On Tuesday he sat comfortably with that idea, making the case that the U.S. should look inward to enact some of the solutions it has spent generations<br />
&#8216;For too long, we&#8217;ve watched our middle class shrink as we&#8217;ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries,&#8217; he said.<br />
&#8216;We&#8217;ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit – and so many other places throughout our land.<br />
&#8216;We&#8217;ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross &#8212; and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.<br />
&#8216;And we&#8217;ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.&#8217;<br />
Trump painted his own political rise as the antidote, saying that last year &#8216;the earth shifted beneath our feet&#8217; as a quiet conservative counter-culture became a &#8216;loud chorus&#8217; and then a political &#8216;earthquake&#8217; of millions who elected him.<br />
Later he declared that while &#8216;America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path,&#8217; his own job is &#8216;not to represent the world: My job is to represent the United States of America.&#8217;<br />
More members of Congress – including a nearly full complement of Democrats – heard Trump&#8217;s message Tuesday in person than anything the brash billionaire had said previously.</p>
<p><strong>FIVE MINUTE OVATION AS HE ENTERED TO CHEERS</strong><br />
Following a rash of Democratic boycotts of his January 20 inauguration, only one – Rep. Maxine Waters of California – announced that she would purposely skip Tuesday&#8217;s speech.<br />
The far-left partisan reportedly said during a Democratic Caucus meeting that any lawmaker &#8216;who can&#8217;t sit still shouldn&#8217;t go.&#8217;<br />
Others, including New York Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, said they would attend but go out of their way to avoid shaking Trump&#8217;s hand – something few members of Congress get close enough to do.<br />
Texas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee, known for hogging an aisle seat every time President Barack Obama delivered a State of the Union speech – the better to be seen on TV shaking his hand – said through a spokesman that she didn&#8217;t plan to repeat the effort.<br />
New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell, another Democrat, was also fond of sitting on the aisle so he could share a few words with Obama once a year.<br />
But as Trump turned the page and builds his own relationship with Congress, Pascrell told Fox News: &#8216;I will not take an aisle seat.&#8217;<br />
Trump entered the House chamber to raucous cheers from the GOP and polite claps from Democrats.<br />
He pumped a fist, straightened his blue-and-white striped tie, and acknowledged more than five minutes of sustained applause. Another ovation came after House Speaker Paul Ryan pounded a ceremonial gavel and introduced him<br />
The occasion of a president&#8217;s first speech before the entire federal legislature and most of his cabinet – one member always stays away as a &#8216;designated survivor&#8217; in case of the unthinkable – is a &#8216;State of the Union&#8217; address in all but name.</p>
<p><strong>CAMPAIGN PLEDGE TO REPEAL OBAMACARE GETS FRESH AIRING</strong><br />
On Tuesday that honor went to Veterans Administration Secretary David Shulkin.<br />
Trump&#8217;s main job Tuesday and in the days that follow is to give his administration a booster shot of enthusiasm.<br />
Many of the key issues in the president&#8217;s stable, all campaign rally standards, had lost their luster in the corrosive air of government.<br />
His once-rock-solid pledge to begin repealing and replacing Obamacare on the first day of his presidency ran into the buzz saw of internal Republican politics, with warring factions disagreeing about whether the two halves of the promise need to happen simultaneously.<br />
Bernie Sanders was in high spirits as he greeted colleagues before the speech<br />

Bernie Sanders was in high spirits as he greeted colleagues before the speech<br />
Trump&#8217;s prepared remarks include a firm marker, however, demanding &#8216;reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time provide better health care.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;Mandating every American to buy government approved health insurance was never the right solution for America,&#8217; Trump said.<br />
&#8216;The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance and that is what we will do.&#8217;<br />
Trump once vowed to rebuild America&#8217;s &#8216;decimated&#8217; military, but the reality of cutting $54 billion per year from domestic spending to pay for it has drawn jaundiced stares on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle.<br />
Even his signature issue – illegal immigration – has seen the Trumpian bravado quieted into a quietly whispered cascade of maybes.<br />
On Tuesday afternoon multiple sources in a lunch meeting the president held with television anchors said he made an overture to Democrats about an immigration reform proposal.<br />
&#8216;The time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides,&#8217; he reportedly said.<br />
Those words hung in the Washington air for hours on Tuesday as pundits and lawmakers alike wondered if Trump was ready to embrace the kind of &#8216;Gang of Eight&#8217; compromise he mocked during the Republican primary season.<br />
A law offering some illegal immigrants a pathway to legal status – or even citizenship – was the sort of sausage-making that made Marco Rubio&#8217;s path to the White House impossibly fraught.</p>
<p><strong>MELANIA GETS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT</strong><br />
His first move may be to lower the bar for so-called &#8216;DREAMers,&#8217; people illegally brought to the U.S. years ago when they were children.<br />
Trump called their situation &#8216;very, very difficult&#8217; during a press conference just a dozen days ago.<br />
&#8216;To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids &#8230; they were brought in here in such a way. It’s a very, very tough subject,&#8217; he said, while emphasizing that some of them have turned criminal and should be deported.<br />
The president&#8217;s campaign persona emphasized a one-size-fits-all approach, saying last August that every illegal immigrant would have &#8216;to return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else,&#8217; as part of his bid to &#8216;break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration.<br />
There is a long tradition of the party out of power sitting out applause lines thrown at them by the president during a speech they are forced to watch on camera.<br />
Democrats on Tuesday took their opposition to a new level. When the president got announced and entered the chamber, dozens of Democrats stood, but kept blank expressions on their faces and refrained from clapping.<br />
Even when Trump made non-controversial statements about lowering prescription drug costs, many Democrats sat on their hands.<br />
There were a few holdovers from the traditional theater that comes with the speech.<br />
When First Lady Melania Trump first entered the chamber – after an awkward interlude where she stood without waving – the chamber erupted into a big round of applause with approving yells.</p>
<p>&#8216;Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America:<br />
&#8216;Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation&#8217;s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week&#8217;s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.<br />
&#8216;Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice –- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.<br />
&#8216;That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.<br />
&#8216;A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.<br />
&#8216;A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.<br />
&#8216;And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.<br />
&#8216;What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.<br />
&#8216;Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.<br />
&#8216;All the nations of the world &#8212; friend or foe &#8212; will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.<br />
&#8216;In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding &#8212; 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.<br />
&#8216;It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.<br />
&#8216;But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?<br />
&#8216;I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.<br />
&#8216;For too long, we&#8217;ve watched our middle class shrink as we&#8217;ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.<br />
&#8216;We&#8217;ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit &#8212; and so many other places throughout our land.<br />
&#8216;We&#8217;ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross &#8212; and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.<br />
&#8216;And we&#8217;ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.<br />
&#8216;Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -– families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.<br />
&#8216;But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus &#8212; as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.<br />
&#8216;Finally, the chorus became an earthquake – and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first &#8230; because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.<br />
&#8216;Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.<br />
&#8216;Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.<br />
&#8216;Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.<br />
&#8216;Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.<br />
&#8216;And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.<br />
&#8216;Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.<br />
&#8216;It&#8217;s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I&#8217;ve made in keeping those promises.<br />
&#8216;Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.<br />
&#8216;The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We&#8217;ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.<br />
&#8216;We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials –- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.<br />
&#8216;We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.<br />
&#8216;We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines &#8212; thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs &#8212; and I&#8217;ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.<br />
&#8216;We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.<br />
&#8216;With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.<br />
&#8216;To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.<br />
&#8216;I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.<br />
&#8216;We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth &#8212; and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.<br />
&#8216;At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed –- but that can&#8217;t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.<br />
&#8216;For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.<br />
&#8216;As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.<br />
&#8216;To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?<br />
&#8216;Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.<br />
&#8216;According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home -– from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.<br />
&#8216;We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.<br />
&#8216;It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.<br />
&#8216;We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America &#8212; we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.<br />
&#8216;That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe &#8212; and to keep out those who would do us harm.<br />
&#8216;As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS &#8212; a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.<br />
&#8216;I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran&#8217;s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.<br />
&#8216;Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court &#8212; from my list of 20 judges &#8212; who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.<br />
&#8216;Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.<br />
&#8216;Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.<br />
&#8216;Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.<br />
&#8216;More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.<br />
&#8216;We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.<br />
&#8216;In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.<br />
&#8216;We&#8217;ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we&#8217;ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.<br />
&#8216;Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.<br />
&#8216;And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.<br />
&#8216;Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.<br />
&#8216;But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy &#8212; making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.<br />
&#8216;Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.<br />
&#8216;My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.<br />
&#8216;We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.<br />
&#8216;Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes &#8212; but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.<br />
&#8216;I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.<br />
&#8216;At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it&#8217;s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me &#8212; without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it &#8212; that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.<br />
&#8216;They weren&#8217;t even asking for change. But I am.<br />
&#8216;I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.<br />
&#8216;The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the &#8220;abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.&#8221;<br />
&#8216;Lincoln was right &#8212; and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.<br />
&#8216;I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.<br />
&#8216;Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others –- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America&#8217;s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.<br />
&#8216;Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers&#8217; wages, and help struggling families –- including immigrant families –- enter the middle class.<br />
&#8216;I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’s security, and to restore respect for our laws.<br />
&#8216;If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.<br />
&#8216;Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program –- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.<br />
&#8216;America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country –- twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.<br />
&#8216;To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States &#8212; financed through both public and private capital –- creating millions of new jobs.<br />
&#8216;This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.<br />
&#8216;Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.<br />
&#8216;Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.<br />
&#8216;Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State &#8212; it is unsustainable and collapsing.<br />
&#8216;One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges –- leaving many Americans with no choice at all.<br />
&#8216;Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?<br />
&#8216;We now know that all of those promises have been broken.<br />
&#8216;Obamacare is collapsing –- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice –- it is a necessity.<br />
&#8216;So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.<br />
&#8216;Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:<br />
&#8216;First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.<br />
&#8216;Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts –- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.<br />
&#8216;Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.<br />
&#8216;Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance – and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.<br />
&#8216;Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines –- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.<br />
&#8216;Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.<br />
&#8216;Our citizens deserve this, and so much more –- so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.<br />
&#8216;My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women&#8217;s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.<br />
&#8216;True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.<br />
&#8216;An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.<br />
&#8216;Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.<br />
&#8216;On receiving this news, Megan&#8217;s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan&#8217;s life. Today she is 20 years old &#8212; and a sophomore at Notre Dame.<br />
&#8216;Megan&#8217;s story is about the unbounded power of a father&#8217;s love for a daughter.<br />
&#8216;But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan&#8217;s life, from reaching those in need.<br />
&#8216;If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.<br />
&#8216;In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.<br />
&#8216;But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind –- and the souls –- of every American child.<br />
&#8216;Education is the civil rights issue of our time.<br />
&#8216;I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.<br />
&#8216;Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.<br />
&#8216;We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.<br />
&#8216;But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.<br />
&#8216;The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.<br />
&#8216;In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone –- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.<br />
&#8216;This is not acceptable in our society.<br />
&#8216;Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.<br />
&#8216;But to create this future, we must work with –- not against -– the men and women of law enforcement.<br />
&#8216;We must build bridges of cooperation and trust –- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.<br />
&#8216;Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters – and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they&#8217;ll come home safe and sound.<br />
&#8216;We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.<br />
&#8216;And we must support the victims of crime.<br />
&#8216;I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE –- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.<br />
&#8216;Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.<br />
&#8216;Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.<br />
&#8216;Jamiel&#8217;s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.<br />
&#8216;Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands –- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis –- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.<br />
&#8216;Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.<br />
&#8216;To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know –- we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.<br />
&#8216;Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and –- if they must –- to fight and to win.<br />
&#8216;I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.<br />
&#8216;My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.<br />
&#8216;Our veterans have delivered for this Nation –- and now we must deliver for them.<br />
&#8216;The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.<br />
&#8216;And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.<br />
&#8216;We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William &#8220;Ryan&#8221; Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero –- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.<br />
&#8216;I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, &#8220;Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.&#8221; Ryan&#8217;s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one&#8217;s life for one&#8217;s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom –- we will never forget him.<br />
&#8216;To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.<br />
&#8216;Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.<br />
&#8216;We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.<br />
&#8216;But our partners must meet their financial obligations.<br />
&#8216;And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.<br />
&#8216;We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific –- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.<br />
&#8216;We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.<br />
&#8216;Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people –- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict &#8212; not more.<br />
&#8216;We must learn from the mistakes of the past –- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.<br />
&#8216;The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.<br />
&#8216;America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.<br />
&#8216;We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.<br />
&#8216;Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.<br />
&#8216;On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America&#8217;s centennial. At that celebration, the country&#8217;s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.<br />
&#8216;Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.<br />
&#8216;Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.<br />
&#8216;Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.<br />
&#8216;Imagine the wonders our country could know in America&#8217;s 250th year.<br />
&#8216;Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.<br />
&#8216;Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.<br />
&#8216;American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.<br />
&#8216;Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.<br />
&#8216;And streets where mothers are safe from fear &#8212; schools where children learn in peace &#8212; and jobs where Americans prosper and grow &#8212; are not too much to ask.<br />
&#8216;When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.<br />
&#8216;This is our vision. This is our mission.<br />
&#8216;But we can only get there together.<br />
&#8216;We are one people, with one destiny.<br />
&#8216;We all bleed the same blood.<br />
&#8216;We all salute the same flag.<br />
&#8216;And we are all made by the same God.<br />
&#8216;And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.<br />
&#8216;The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.<br />
&#8216;We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.<br />
&#8216;The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.<br />
&#8216;And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.<br />
&#8216;From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears –- inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past –- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.<br />
&#8216;I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and &#8212;<br />
&#8216;Believe in yourselves.<br />
&#8216;Believe in your future.<br />
&#8216;And believe, once more, in America.<br />
&#8216;Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States.&#8217;<br />

          <p>President Trump promised to lower taxes, combat terrorism and replace the Affordable Care Act in a speech to a joint session of Congress, Feb. 28. Here are key moments from that speech. (Video: Sarah Parnass/Photo: Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)<br />
By Philip Rucker and Robert Costa February 28 at 11:29 PM<br />
President Trump sought to repackage his hard-line campaign promises with a moderate sheen Tuesday night, declaring what he termed “a new chapter of American greatness” of economic renewal and military might in his first joint address to Congress.</p>
<p>Seeking to steady his presidency after a tumultuous first 40 days, Trump had an air of seriousness and revealed flashes of compassion as he broadly outlined a sweeping agenda to rebuild a country he described as ravaged by crime and drugs, deteriorating infrastructure and failing bureaucracies.</p>
<p>Trump’s 60-minute speech touched on his plans to overhaul the nation’s health-care system and tax code, but it was short on specifics and heavy on lofty prose. Struggling to steer a bitterly divided nation with his job-approval ratings at historic lows, Trump effectively pleaded with the American people to give him a chance and to imagine what could be achieved during his presidency.</p>
<p>“We are one people, with one destiny,” Trump said quietly near the end. “The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.”</p>
<p>Trump extended olive branches to his opponents. He called on Congress to pass paid family leave, a reference to a long-held Democratic Party priority that brought liberal lawmakers to their feet to applaud. And he pledged to work with Muslim allies to extinguish Islamic State terrorists, going so far as to acknowledge the killings of Muslims as well as Christians in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Still, Trump did not back away from his most controversial policies. He used typically bellicose language to describe the fight against the Islamic State, calling it “a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs.” He made a point to utter the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism,” which Republicans cheered heartily.</p>
<p>[President Trump’s joint address to Congress, annotated]</p>
<p>The president forcefully defended his travel ban of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries — an executive order that was halted in federal court — as necessary to prevent the entry of foreigners who do not share America’s values.</p>
<p>“We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America,” Trump said. “We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.”</p>
<p>The president trumpeted his plans to budget a major increase in military spending. One of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics, Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), stood enthusiastically when the president said he would end the “defense sequester” caps on Pentagon spending.<br />
On foreign affairs, Trump said he would honor historic alliances — and explicitly stated his support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, on which he had wavered during his campaign — but said he would seek new ones as well, even with former adversaries. The latter seemed an indirect reference to potentially working to combat terrorism with Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded meddled in the November election in hopes of helping Trump.</p>
<p>“America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where share interests align,” Trump said. “We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.”</p>

<p>The New York Times Fact Checks Trump: All True<br />
ROBERT DONACHIE<br />
Finance Reporter</p>
<p>Nearly every word of President Donald Trump’s first address to Congress was true, according to The New York Times fact check.</p>
<p>Reporters from the NYT sourced through each statement the president made in Tuesday night’s speech, which touched on: violent crime, immigration, border control, health care reform, labor, and energy. While the NYT labeled Trump’s comments as true, it did hedge heavily a few times, expressing reticence to call the president’s statements “true.”</p>
<p>For instance, the president addressed the rise in violent crime in the nation. Trump said the “murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.” There were an estimated 15,696 murders in the U.S. in 2015, a 10 percent increase from 2014. The NYT concedes that fact, but it includes a caveat, labeling the president’s statement as “true, but somewhat misleading.”</p>
<p>The president’s statement is misleading because crime has been “falling for a generation,” the NYT reports. “In 1991, the F.B.I. estimated that there were 24,703 murders.” The president, however, was not addressing the fluctuations in crime rates in a general sense. His comments were specifically in reference to 2015’s murder rate, and not aimed at the overall trend in crime.</p>

<p>Missouri has no illegal&#8217;s; go figure&#8230; Shouldn&#8217;t the other states do the same? Missouri&#8217;s approach to the problem of illegal immigration appears to be more advanced, sophisticated, strict and effective than anything to date in Arizona . Does the White House appreciate what Missouri has done? So, why doesn&#8217;t Missouri receive attention? Answer: There are no illegal&#8217;s in Missouri to demonstrate.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Show Me&#8221; state has again shown us how it should be done. There needs to be more publicity and exposure regarding what Missouri has done. Please pass this around.</p>
<p>In 2007, Missouri placed on the ballot a proposed constitutional amendment designating English as the official language of Missouri . In November, 2008, nearly 90% voted in favor! Thus, English became the official language for ALL governmental activity in Missouri . No individual has the right to demand government services in a language OTHER than English.</p>
<p>In 2008, a measure was passed that required the Missouri Highway Patrol and other law enforcement officials to verify the immigration status of any person arrested, and inform federal authorities if the person is found to be in Missouri illegally. Missouri law enforcement officers receive specific training with respect to enforcement of federal immigration laws.</p>
<p>In Missouri, illegal immigrants do NOT have access to taxpayer benefits such as food stamps or health care through Missouri Health NET.</p>
<p>In 2009, a measure was passed that ensures Missouri &#8216;s public institutions of higher education do NOT award financial aid to individuals who are illegally in the United States .</p>
<p>In Missouri all post-secondary institutions of higher education are required to annually certify to the Missouri Dept. Of Higher Education that they have NOT knowingly awarded financial aid to students who are unlawfully present in the United States .</p>
<p>So, while Arizona has made national news for its new law, it is important to remember, Missouri has been far more proactive in addressing this horrific problem. Missouri has made it clear that illegal immigrants are NOT WELCOME in the state and they will NOT receive public benefits at the expense of Missouri taxpayers.</p>
<p>DON&#8217;T DELETE THIS AMERICA . KEEP IT GOING UNTIL WE GET ALL 50 STATES TO COMPLY!</p>

<p>John McCain may have served America with honor in the Vietnam war, but his attempt to be something for everyone is falling flat. In fact, McCain is so despised amongst Republican base voters that they are now calling him a traitor on Social Media.</p>
<p>But how can he be the most hated politician in America?</p>
<p>Easy: Democrats have hated him since 2008 when they trashed him against Obama. Now in 2017, McCain is angering the broad base of Republican voters by calling Trump a “dictator” and going overseas to trash the President.</p>
<p>So if Democrats dislike McCain for being a Republican, and Republicans hate McCain for kissing the butts of the Democrats, who the heck does he speak for?<br />
No one knows.</p>
<p>Check out some brutal tweets.</p>
<p>Want more? Follow us on Facebook This is highly interesting. But it goes without saying.</p>
<p>Sen. John McCain spoke out Saturday in defense of the free press after President Trump lashed out against the news media several times over the past week, at one point declaring it “the enemy of the American People!”</p>
<p>Such talk, McCain (R-Ariz.) said on NBC News in an interview set to air Sunday, was “how dictators get started.”</p>
<p>“In other words, a consolidation of power,” McCain told “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd from Munich. “When you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press. And I&#8217;m not saying that President Trump is trying to be a dictator. I&#8217;m just saying we need to learn the lessons of history.”</p>

<p>The 80-year-old Republican senator was responding to several tweets by Trump over the past week, in which he repeatedly attacked the media as “fake news.” In one widely shared tweet Friday, Trump said the press was “not my enemy” but that of the American people.</p>
<p>[Enemy of the people: A history of use, from Nero and Hitler to Stalin and Mao]</p>
<p>In it, Trump tagged the New York Times, CNN and broadcast news networks NBC, ABC and CBS.</p>

“A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.” — Ronald Reagan</p>
<p>Former President Barack Obama is not finished with his deconstruction of the United States and the U.S. Constitution. Operating out of D.C., Obama has 30,000 minions who are spreading discontent throughout the country. He oversees his group, Organizing for Action, out of his mansion which is a stone’s throw from the corridors of Congress.</p>
<p>For the past eight years Obama has delivered endless excuses for Islamic extremism and expressed his disdain over America’s past. It seems apparent to me that Obama has political leanings which were taught to him by his Muslim father and stepfather.</p>
<p>After his first public statement since leaving office, The New York Post said this about the former president:</p>
<p>When former President Barack Obama said he was “heartened” by anti-Trump protests, he was sending a message of approval to his troops. Troops? Yes, Obama has an army of agitators — numbering more than 30,000 — who will fight his Republican successor at every turn of his historic presidency. And Obama will command them from a bunker less than two miles from the White House.</p>
<p>In what’s shaping up to be a highly unusual post-presidency, Obama isn’t just staying behind in Washington. He’s working behind the scenes to set up what will effectively be a shadow government…</p>
<p>Obama’s first battle-line is immigration and President Donald Trump’s promise to protect America’s borders. This was a key issue in the November election and a major reason why Trump won.</p>
<p>Under the Obama administration, somehow the word illegal took on a whole new meaning. Mainstream news regurgitates the plight of illegal aliens and reports favorably on the 41 sanctuary cities that protect them.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2016, The New York Times ran a story with a boohoo video of Latino children and this startling sentence, “Trump said he would crack down on and deport millions of undocumented immigrants.”</p>
<p>It just seems like common sense to me that if they are illegal they should be dealt with as any group that breaks the law. There are no sanctuary cities for bank robbers. That is because it is illegal to rob banks. But Mexicans and other Latin Americans are swarming into the country. The principal reason the flow of illegals has plateaued is because of the lingering recession that Obama failed to end.</p>
<p>Obama’s dream is America’s nightmare</p>
<p>Plainly, the bulk of illegal immigrants came to the country before Obama was president and before the 2001 DREAM Act, that Congress did not pass, which would have made it easier for undocumented (i.e. illegal) immigrants to get permanent residency. Obama is the biggest advocate of the DREAM Act or any legislation that would make it easier for illegals to enter and stay in the United States.</p>
<p>In 2012, after Obama understood that the DREAM Act was not going to be passed during his second term, he did what he is known for — he went around Congress.</p>
<p>On June 15, 2012, Obama announced that his administration would stop deporting young undocumented individuals who match certain criteria previously proposed under the DREAM Act. It is called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and as of January 2017, 740,000 illegals have taken advantage of it.</p>
<p>Charles Krauthammer told Chris Wallace of Fox News that Obama’s actions:</p>
<p>Beyond the pandering, beyond the politics, beyond the process — is simple constitutional decency. This is out-and-out lawlessness. You had a clip of the president himself say months ago ‘I cannot do this on my own because there are laws on the books.’ Well, I have news for the president — the laws remain on the books. They haven’t changed.</p>
<p>My personal battle to immigrate</p>
<p>When you get a president like Trump saying illegal aliens will be dealt with according to the laws on the books, cable news go wall-to-wall with segments showing children being ripped away from their deported parents and the liberals bring out the tissues for their tears. They paint it as if were the SS separating Jews from their children. And the evil behind this — they tell you — is Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Wake up! Immigration laws that Trump wants to enforce are the ones that have been around since the 1970s, with many of the current immigration laws set down during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, a liberal Caspar Milquetoast. So if Trump is a racist tyrant, so was Carter.</p>
<p>About the time President Ronald Reagan took office, I was one of the very few people that gave a rat’s rump over the plight of illegal immigrants. I cared because one arm of the U.S. government said I was entitled to a green card that provided permanent residency because my father was an American citizen. Another arm of the government disagreed and said my wife and I should be deported. That our three kids were American born? Tough luck!</p>
<p>The decision went before a judge who took years to decide. During that time I had a working visa. I accepted that if I lost my court case I would have to move back to Canada.</p>
<p>We won our court case. After being thoroughly vetted, my wife and I received our green cards. That meant I could finally stop worrying about deportation.</p>
<p>After a few more years I took my citizenship test and was again extensively questioned by an agent at the local INS office. This was a few years before anyone had heard of al-Qaida.</p>
<p>I remember one of the questions the agent asked me was how could I be useful to the nation if war broke out? That interview was in 1998. Nineteen years later, for Muslims that have no official records, the question should be, “Are you a radical and do you support a jihad against America?”</p>
<p>The fact is that Islamic extremism has never had so many devotees spread through so much of the world. This has happened during Obama’s two terms.</p>
<p>Much of the liberal crying and hand wringing about illegal aliens these past two months is orchestrated by Obama’s political army, Organizing for Action. You don’t have to even like Trump or be a Republican to understand that as president, Trump has the authority to impose a temporary ban on immigration from seven countries; the same seven countries identified by the Obama administration as the most dangerous nations in the world with regard to supporting Islamic terrorism.</p>
<p>I am not a racist but a realist</p>
<p>I hold Muslims in a different category than other religions. That doesn’t make me a racist. It makes me a realist. There are millions of Muslims that want to see Americans killed.</p>
<p>The Center for Security Policy released a poll in June 2015 showing that 51 percent of the 3.3 million Muslims living in America believe they should have a choice of being governed by Shariah law. More disturbing is that 700,000 Muslims already living in the country said that violence is justified in order to implement Shariah as the law of the United States.</p>
<p>Liberals do not understand this risk. But I know too many liberals who, misguided as they are, are very intelligent. Obama’s exaggerated compliance with many Islamic kings and dictators and his organization’s personal attacks on Trump show how divided the nation has become. And to his discredit, much of the fault rests with Obama.</p>
<p>Obama is an insult to the presidency and the nation</p>
<p>A few years ago I recommended a just-published book, The President’s Club, by Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy. The book is fascinating in that it shows how past presidents form a bond that not only stops them from criticizing the current commander-in-chief, but other former presidents as well.</p>
<p>Its genesis began when ex-presidents Herbert Hoover and Harry S. Truman joked about starting “a former presidents club” while visiting at the inauguration of President Eisenhower. The book traces the many deep friendships that happened between past presidents who shared one thing in common — they loved their country. One of the more strange friendships was between former presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon; rivals in politics, confidants in retirement.</p>
<p>But in the end it boils down to common decency. In 2014, George W. Bush was asked why he never criticized Obama. Bush’s answer: “I don’t think it’s good for the country to have a former president undermine a current president; I think it’s bad for the presidency for that matter.”</p>
<p>Obama doesn’t have respect for either the office of president or the country itself. If the president does poorly, so does the nation.</p>
<p>Obama might be the only past president to think that is a good thing. Obama has created an organization that has as one of its tenants the ruination of Donald Trump. Obama is infusing so much hostility that Trump has little chance in making America great again.</p>
<p>Yours in good times and bad,</p>
<p>— John Myers</p>

          <p>Parents in Chatham, New Jersey are demanding answers from the local board of education as it pertains to what their children are being taught in their 7th grade social studies class. According to Nancy Gayer and Libby Hilsenrath, their children are being given lessons about Islam that would never be acceptable if they were about Christianity.</p>
<p>In fact, Gayer said at a board meeting on Monday, her son was specifically chastised a few years ago when he gave a PowerPoint presentation that briefly mentioned his religious views. Gayer said he was told to stop “proselytizing” when he included a Bible quote in his slideslow. The teacher told him that a quote like that “belongs in Sunday School.”</p>
<p>Gayer and other parents asked the board to explain why that was off-limits, but it was perfectly fine for the teacher to have the students learn about the religious tenets of Islam.</p>
<p>“My sincere issue – according to policy 2270 – the board of education directs that no religious beliefs be promoted or disparaged,” Gayer said at the meeting. “I’m asking the board meet with the policy committee and eliminate the teaching of Islam and all other religions.”</p>
<p>Hilsenrath passed out materials being used in the classroom, which included a cartoon that made extraordinary statements about Islam.</p>
<p>“It even goes so far as even making a statement “There is no God except Allah,” Hilsenrath said. “This video also states that Allah is the maker of everything, the one true God, etc. The main character is the cartoon video is looking for converts.”</p>
<p>Hilsenrath said that the argument for the educational materials – that it would expose the students to religions they don’t know much about – did not pass muster. She argued that many of the students were almost certainly ignorant about the finer points of Judaism and Christianity as well, yet those religions were barely mentioned in the classroom. Certainly, she said, they were not taught in the same way as Islam.</p>
<p>It’s real simple: Either religious studies need to be barred from public schools, or there needs to be equal time given to all of the world’s major religions. Anything that strays from that premise invites unnecessary controversy, especially when the teachings are as off-the-wall as the ones seen here.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve seen parents outraged over Islamic indoctrination in the school system. The more it occurs, the more you have to wonder if there isn’t something a bit more sinister going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>McCain is backing an amendment proposed by democrats that would increase the amount of Afghan immigrants to the U.S. by up to 36%. The increased cost would end up being covered with cash that was originally set aside for U.S. veterans’ programs.</p>
<p>“The amendment proposed by New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen — and supported by McCain — will increase the number of Afghan Special Immigrant Visas for people who have aided U.S. soldiers as interpreters or translators. The number of visas will rise from 7,000 to 11,000, and each visa holder can bring spouses and their children to the United States.</p>
<p>“Congress cut healthcare benefits to veterans in the 2016 budget by increasing pharmacy co-pays — using some of those savings to fund an expansion of the Afghan Special Immigrant Visas program, according to The Daily Caller News Foundation. The money could have been taken from other spending accounts, such as programs at the State Department.”</p>

<p>The U.S. government is having enough trouble getting our veterans the assistance they deserve, let alone with people like John McCain stifling their coffers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has rescued the U.S. He has now reduced the US Debt burden in his first month in office. Check this out, check this out, check it!</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnyGV-vjtr4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>On January 20th, the U.S. debt was at $19,947 billion. OMG! That’s ridiculous, right?</p>
<p>From Liberty Writers News</p>
<p>On January 20rst, the US Debt was at $19,947 billion.<br />
Exactly a month later on February 21rst, the debt stood at $19,935 billion.<br />
TRUMP HAS CUT THE DEBT BY $12 BILLION.</p>
<p>Trump has cut 0.1% in his first month in office!</p>

<p>At first that doesn’t sound like a lot but compare it with this…. Under President Obama, President Obama increased the US Debt burden by more than $200 billion. Obama increased the US Debt 2% in his first month. He signed the trillion-dollar ‘stimulus‘ bill that was considered a massive failure of US tax dollars. Obama doubled the US Debt during his Presidency.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-53708" src="http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2017/02/24Obama-Debt-1st-Mo-550x446.png" alt="" width="550" height="446" srcset="http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2017/02/24Obama-Debt-1st-Mo-550x446.png 550w, http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2017/02/24Obama-Debt-1st-Mo-300x243.png 300w, http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2017/02/24Obama-Debt-1st-Mo.png 673w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p>We will not stop winning. We cannot stop winning. Doesn’t it feel good to finally be winning? Winning, winning, winning is all we do under Trump.</p>
<p>YOU WILL NOT SEE THIS ON THE MEDIA.</p>
<p>Let’s fix that. Help us get this information out. Let the nation know that Trump is keeping his campaign promise, and for the first time in a while, we are balancing the budget.</p>
