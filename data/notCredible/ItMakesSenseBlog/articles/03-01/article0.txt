time for small thinking is over, the time for trivial fights is behind us.&#8217;<br />\nAt that very moment, a member of the Democratic Party hissed.<br />\nBut Trump&#8217;s 60-minute speech drew 94 interruptions for applause, including a sustained, tear-jerking ovation for the widow of a Navy SEAL killed in action just eight days after Trump took office.<br />\nAs Carryn Owens wept and Ivanka Trump comforted her, Trump said her husband Ryan was happy that the lengthy applause &#8216;broke a record.&#8217;<br />\nThe slain sailor&#8217;s father made headlines last week when he said he had refused to speak with the president when his son&#8217;s remains were returned to the U.S. in a somber ceremony. He also blasted Trump for green-lighting what he called the &#8216;stupid mission&#8217; that claimed Ryan&#8217;s life.<br />\nBut the president praised Ryan as &#8216;a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.&#8217;<br />\n&#8216;Ryan&#8217;s legacy is etched into eternity&#8217; Trump said. &#8216;For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one&#8217;s life for one&#8217;s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom.

Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.&#8217;<br />\nTrump, 70, was predicting a safer and more prosperous world when America celebrates its 250th birthday in 2026. He noted the centennial celebrations in 1876 where &#8216;the country&#8217;s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations&#8217; in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p><strong>DEMOCRATS LAUGHED, HISSED AND GASPED</strong><br />\nTrump made appeal after appeal for bipartisan cooperation, but Democrats were anything but unanimously receptive.<br />\nSEAL HERO PRAISED<br />\nRyan&#8217;s legacy is etched into eternity.

We will never forget Ryan.<br />\nTrump, paying tribute to Ryan Owens, a Navy SEAL who perished in a military operation late last month<br />\nSome of them laughed out loud when the president bragged that he has &#8216;begun to drain the swamp of government corruption.&#8217;<br />\nOthers gasped in audible disbelief when he announced the formation of a government department to assist victims of illegal-immigrant criminals.<br />\nThen came the hissing when he announced that &#8216;the time for trivial fights is behind us.&#8217;<br />\nDemocrats sat, arms folded, as he rattled off a laundry list of his supporters&#8217; red meat slogans \u2013 all with the usual panache.<br />\n&#8216;We will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border,&#8217; he said. &#8216;It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.&#8217;<br />\nAnd he doubled down on efforts to pause admissions to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority nations where limited screening capacity has left question marks next to countless incoming travelers.<br />\n&#8216;It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur,&#8217; he said.<br />\nDemocrats have already pilloried Trump through days of tumult as his White House endured an error-ridden rollout of his travel ban order.<br />\nThey descended into Schadenfreude as the investigative saga of his campaign&#8217;s alleged Moscow ties took on new and ever more threatening forms.<br />\nThey mocked the Trump administration&#8217;s leak-prone inner circle.

Both men were guests of congressmen.<br />\nHannity, a Fox News conservative, applauded and roared as Trump outlined his agenda. MSNBC&#8217;s Scarborough, a former Republican congressman who now mocks the White House daily, scowled and shook his head.<br />\nTrump began Tuesday night with a claim on the role of political peacemaker, saying he wanted to bring Americans who voted for him together with those who didn&#8217;t<br />\n+51<br />\nTrump began Tuesday night with a claim on the role of political peacemaker, saying he wanted to bring Americans who voted for him together with those who didn&#8217;t<br />\nTrump called on Tuesday for Congress to &#8216;increase funding for our veterans,&#8217; pass &#8216;historic tax reform&#8217; for middle-class Americans, make good on his campaign pledge to &#8216;repeal and replace Obamacare,&#8217; help soften the financial burden of child care, and &#8216;help ensure new parents have paid family leave.&#8217;<br />\nHis speech also included a demand that the government &#8216;invest in women&#8217;s health&#8217; and &#8216;promote clean air and clean water and rebuild our military infrastructure.&#8217;<br />\nAnd Trump boasted that &#8216;by finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.&#8217;<br />\nTrump&#8217;s domestic policy prescriptions were led by his death prognosis for the Obamacare medical insurance overhaul experiment.<br />\n&#8216;Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do,&#8217; he pledged.<br />\n&#8216;Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken.&#8217;<br />\nTrump said he will support retaining one aspect of the Affordable Care Act, ensuring that patients with pre-existing medical conditions can&#8217;t be denied insurance coverage.<br />\nHe also demanded &#8216;a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.&#8217;</p>\n<p><strong>NO BACKING DOWN: SCHOOL CHOICE AND DEPORTATIONS</strong><br />\nThe president challenged Congress to develop a plan that will use tax credits and &#8216;Health Savings Accounts&#8217; to give Americans a broader choice of plans \u2013 including those offered by insurance companies in other states.<br />\nTrump also planted a stake in the ground for school-choice advocates, saying that &#8216;education is the civil rights issue of our time.&#8217;<br />\nHe asked Congress for an education bill &#8216;that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.&#8217;<br />\n&#8216;These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them,&#8217; he said.<br />\nAnother dramatic moment came when he acknowledged Jamiel Shaw, the father of a 17-year-old boy who was &#8216;viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.&#8217;<br />\nShaw, along with a group of &#8216;Angel Moms&#8217; who lost children in similar attacks, was a fixture at Trump campaign rallies.<br />\nNext to him sat the widows of two police officers &#8216;gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.&#8217;<br />\nThe central philosophy of the president&#8217;s economic and foreign policies is the &#8216;America first&#8217; agenda he promised would guide him in his inauguration speech.</p>\n<p><strong>SOLVE PROBLEMS AT HOME FIRST</strong><br />\nOn Tuesday he sat comfortably with that idea, making the case that the U.S. should look inward to enact some of the solutions it has spent generations<br />\n&#8216;For too long, we&#8217;ve watched our middle class shrink as we&#8217;ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries,&#8217; he said.<br />\n&#8216;We&#8217;ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit \u2013 and so many other places throughout our land.<br />\n&#8216;We&#8217;ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross &#8212; and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.<br />\n&#8216;And we&#8217;ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.&#8217;<br />\nTrump painted his own political rise as the antidote, saying that last year &#8216;the earth shifted beneath our feet&#8217; as a quiet conservative counter-culture became a &#8216;loud chorus&#8217; and then a political &#8216;earthquake&#8217; of millions who elected him.<br />\nLater he declared that while &#8216;America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path,&#8217; his own job is &#8216;not to represent the world: My job is to represent the United States of America.&#8217;<br />\nMore members of Congress \u2013 including a nearly full complement of Democrats \u2013 heard Trump&#8217;s message Tuesday in person than anything the brash billionaire had said previously.</p>\n<p><strong>FIVE MINUTE OVATION AS HE ENTERED TO CHEERS</strong><br />\nFollowing a rash of Democratic boycotts of his January 20 inauguration, only one \u2013 Rep. Maxine Waters of California \u2013 announced that she would purposely skip Tuesday&#8217;s speech.<br />\nThe far-left partisan reportedly said during a Democratic Caucus meeting that any lawmaker &#8216;who can&#8217;t sit still shouldn&#8217;t go.&#8217;<br />\nOthers, including New York Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, said they would attend but go out of their way to avoid shaking Trump&#8217;s hand \u2013 something few members of Congress get close enough to do.<br />\nTexas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee, known for hogging an aisle seat every time President Barack Obama delivered a State of the Union speech \u2013 the better to be seen on TV shaking his hand \u2013 said through a spokesman that she didn&#8217;t plan to repeat the effort.<br />\nNew Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell, another Democrat, was also fond of sitting on the aisle so he could share a few words with Obama once a year.<br />\nBut as Trump turned the page and builds his own relationship with Congress, Pascrell told Fox News: &#8216;I will not take an aisle seat.&#8217;<br />\nTrump entered the House chamber to raucous cheers from the GOP and polite claps from Democrats.<br />\nHe pumped a fist, straightened his blue-and-white striped tie, and acknowledged more than five minutes of sustained applause. Another ovation came after House Speaker Paul Ryan pounded a ceremonial gavel and introduced him<br />\nThe occasion of a president&#8217;s first speech before the entire federal legislature and most of his cabinet \u2013 one member always stays away as a &#8216;designated survivor&#8217; in case of the unthinkable \u2013 is a &#8216;State of the Union&#8217; address in all but name.</p>\n<p><strong>CAMPAIGN PLEDGE TO REPEAL OBAMACARE GETS FRESH AIRING</strong><br />\nOn Tuesday that honor went to Veterans Administration Secretary David Shulkin.<br />\nTrump&#8217;s main job Tuesday and in the days that follow is to give his administration a booster shot of enthusiasm.<br />\nMany of the key issues in the president&#8217;s stable, all campaign rally standards, had lost their luster in the corrosive air of government.<br />\nHis once-rock-solid pledge to begin repealing and replacing Obamacare on the first day of his presidency ran into the buzz saw of internal Republican politics, with warring factions disagreeing about whether the two halves of the promise need to happen simultaneously.<br />\nBernie Sanders was in high spirits as he greeted colleagues before the speech<br />\n+51<br />\nBernie Sanders was in high spirits as he greeted colleagues before the speech<br />\nTrump&#8217;s prepared remarks include a firm marker, however, demanding &#8216;reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time provide better health care.&#8217;<br />\n&#8216;Mandating every American to buy government approved health insurance was never the right solution for America,&#8217; Trump said.<br />\n&#8216;The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance and that is what we will do.&#8217;<br />\nTrump once vowed to rebuild America&#8217;s &#8216;decimated&#8217; military, but the reality of cutting $54 billion per year from domestic spending to pay for it has drawn jaundiced stares on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle.<br />\nEven his signature issue \u2013 illegal immigration \u2013 has seen the Trumpian bravado quieted into a quietly whispered cascade of maybes.<br />\nOn Tuesday afternoon multiple sources in a lunch meeting the president held with television anchors said he made an overture to Democrats about an immigration reform proposal.<br />\n&#8216;The time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides,&#8217; he reportedly said.<br />\nThose words hung in the Washington air for hours on Tuesday as pundits and lawmakers alike wondered if Trump was ready to embrace the kind of &#8216;Gang of Eight&#8217; compromise he mocked during the Republican primary season.<br />\nA law offering some illegal immigrants a pathway to legal status \u2013 or even citizenship \u2013 was the sort of sausage-making that made Marco Rubio&#8217;s path to the White House impossibly fraught.</p>\n<p><strong>MELANIA GETS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT</strong><br />\nHis first move may be to lower the bar for so-called &#8216;DREAMers,&#8217; people illegally brought to the U.S. years ago when they were children.<br />\nTrump called their situation &#8216;very, very difficult&#8217; during a press conference just a dozen days ago.<br />\n&#8216;To me, it\u2019s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids &#8230; they were brought in here in such a way. It\u2019s a very, very tough subject,&#8217; he said, while emphasizing that some of them have turned criminal and should be deported.<br />\nThe president&#8217;s campaign persona emphasized a one-size-fits-all approach, saying last August that every illegal immigrant would have &#8216;to return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else,&#8217; as part of his bid to &#8216;break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration.<br />\nThere is a long tradition of the party out of power sitting out applause lines thrown at them by the president during a speech they are forced to watch on camera.<br />\nDemocrats on Tuesday took their opposition to a new level. When the president got announced and entered the chamber, dozens of Democrats stood, but kept blank expressions on their faces and refrained from clapping.<br />\nEven when Trump made non-controversial statements about lowering prescription drug costs, many Democrats sat on their hands.<br />\nThere were a few holdovers from the traditional theater that comes with the speech.<br />\nWhen First Lady Melania Trump first entered the chamber \u2013 after an awkward interlude where she stood without waving \u2013 the chamber erupted into a big round of applause with approving yells.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America:<br />\n&#8216;Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation&#8217;s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week&#8217;s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.<br />\n&#8216;Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice \u2013- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.<br />\n&#8216;That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.<br />\n&#8216;A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.<br />\n&#8216;A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.<br />\n&#8216;And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.<br />\n&#8216;What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.<br />\n&#8216;Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.<br />\n&#8216;All the nations of the world &#8212; friend or foe &#8212; will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.<br />\n&#8216;In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding &#8212; 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.<br />\n&#8216;It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.<br />\n&#8216;But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?<br />\n&#8216;I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.<br />\n&#8216;For too long, we&#8217;ve watched our middle class shrink as we&#8217;ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.<br />\n&#8216;We&#8217;ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit &#8212; and so many other places throughout our land.<br />\n&#8216;We&#8217;ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross &#8212; and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.<br />\n&#8216;And we&#8217;ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.<br />\n&#8216;Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -\u2013 families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.<br />\n&#8216;But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus &#8212; as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.<br />\n&#8216;Finally, the chorus became an earthquake \u2013 and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first &#8230; because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.<br />\n&#8216;Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.<br />\n&#8216;Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.<br />\n&#8216;Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.<br />\n&#8216;Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.<br />\n&#8216;And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.<br />\n&#8216;Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.<br />\n&#8216;It&#8217;s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I&#8217;ve made in keeping those promises.<br />\n&#8216;Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.<br />\n&#8216;The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We&#8217;ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.<br />\n&#8216;We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials \u2013- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.<br />\n&#8216;We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.<br />\n&#8216;We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines &#8212; thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs &#8212; and I&#8217;ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.<br />\n&#8216;We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.<br />\n&#8216;With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.<br />\n&#8216;To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.<br />\n&#8216;I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.<br />\n&#8216;We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth &#8212; and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.<br />\n&#8216;At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed \u2013- but that can&#8217;t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.<br />\n&#8216;For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.<br />\n&#8216;As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.<br />\n&#8216;To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?<br />\n&#8216;Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.<br />\n&#8216;According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home -\u2013 from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.<br />\n&#8216;We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.<br />\n&#8216;It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.<br />\n&#8216;We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America &#8212; we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.<br />\n&#8216;That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe &#8212; and to keep out those who would do us harm.<br />\n&#8216;As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS &#8212; a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.<br />\n&#8216;I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran&#8217;s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.<br />\n&#8216;Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court &#8212; from my list of 20 judges &#8212; who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.<br />\n&#8216;Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.<br />\n&#8216;Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.<br />\n&#8216;Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.<br />\n&#8216;More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.<br />\n&#8216;We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.<br />\n&#8216;In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.<br />\n&#8216;We&#8217;ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we&#8217;ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.<br />\n&#8216;Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.<br />\n&#8216;And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.<br />\n&#8216;Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.<br />\n&#8216;But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy &#8212; making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.<br />\n&#8216;Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.<br />\n&#8216;My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.<br />\n&#8216;We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.<br />\n&#8216;Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes &#8212; but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.<br />\n&#8216;I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.<br />\n&#8216;At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it&#8217;s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me &#8212; without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it &#8212; that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.<br />\n&#8216;They weren&#8217;t even asking for change. But I am.<br />\n&#8216;I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.<br />\n&#8216;The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the &#8220;abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.&#8221;<br />\n&#8216;Lincoln was right &#8212; and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.<br />\n&#8216;I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.<br />\n&#8216;Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others \u2013- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America&#8217;s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.<br />\n&#8216;Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers&#8217; wages, and help struggling families \u2013- including immigrant families \u2013- enter the middle class.<br />\n&#8216;I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security, and to restore respect for our laws.<br />\n&#8216;If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.<br />\n&#8216;Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program \u2013- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.<br />\n&#8216;America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country \u2013- twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.<br />\n&#8216;To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States &#8212; financed through both public and private capital \u2013- creating millions of new jobs.<br />\n&#8216;This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.<br />\n&#8216;Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.<br />\n&#8216;Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.<br />\n&#8216;Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State &#8212; it is unsustainable and collapsing.<br />\n&#8216;One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges \u2013- leaving many Americans with no choice at all.<br />\n&#8216;Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?<br />\n&#8216;We now know that all of those promises have been broken.<br />\n&#8216;Obamacare is collapsing \u2013- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice \u2013- it is a necessity.<br />\n&#8216;So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.<br />\n&#8216;Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:<br />\n&#8216;First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.<br />\n&#8216;Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts \u2013- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.<br />\n&#8216;Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.<br />\n&#8216;Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance \u2013 and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.<br />\n&#8216;Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines \u2013- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.<br />\n&#8216;Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.<br />\n&#8216;Our citizens deserve this, and so much more \u2013- so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.<br />\n&#8216;My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women&#8217;s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.<br />\n&#8216;True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.<br />\n&#8216;An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.<br />\n&#8216;Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.<br />\n&#8216;On receiving this news, Megan&#8217;s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan&#8217;s life. Today she is 20 years old &#8212; and a sophomore at Notre Dame.<br />\n&#8216;Megan&#8217;s story is about the unbounded power of a father&#8217;s love for a daughter.<br />\n&#8216;But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan&#8217;s life, from reaching those in need.<br />\n&#8216;If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.<br />\n&#8216;In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.<br />\n&#8216;But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind \u2013- and the souls \u2013- of every American child.<br />\n&#8216;Education is the civil rights issue of our time.<br />\n&#8216;I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.<br />\n&#8216;Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.<br />\n&#8216;We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.<br />\n&#8216;But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.<br />\n&#8216;The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.<br />\n&#8216;In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone \u2013- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.<br />\n&#8216;This is not acceptable in our society.<br />\n&#8216;Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.<br />\n&#8216;But to create this future, we must work with \u2013- not against -\u2013 the men and women of law enforcement.<br />\n&#8216;We must build bridges of cooperation and trust \u2013- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.<br />\n&#8216;Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters \u2013 and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they&#8217;ll come home safe and sound.<br />\n&#8216;We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.<br />\n&#8216;And we must support the victims of crime.<br />\n&#8216;I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE \u2013- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.<br />\n&#8216;Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.<br />\n&#8216;Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.<br />\n&#8216;Jamiel&#8217;s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.<br />\n&#8216;Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands \u2013- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis \u2013- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.<br />\n&#8216;Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.<br />\n&#8216;To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know \u2013- we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.<br />\n&#8216;Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and \u2013- if they must \u2013- to fight and to win.<br />\n&#8216;I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.<br />\n&#8216;My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.<br />\n&#8216;Our veterans have delivered for this Nation \u2013- and now we must deliver for them.<br />\n&#8216;The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.<br />\n&#8216;And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.<br />\n&#8216;We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William &#8220;Ryan&#8221; Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero \u2013- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.<br />\n&#8216;I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, &#8220;Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.&#8221; Ryan&#8217;s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one&#8217;s life for one&#8217;s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom \u2013- we will never forget him.<br />\n&#8216;To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.<br />\n&#8216;Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.<br />\n&#8216;We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.<br />\n&#8216;But our partners must meet their financial obligations.<br />\n&#8216;And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.<br />\n&#8216;We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific \u2013- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.<br />\n&#8216;We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.<br />\n&#8216;Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people \u2013- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict &#8212; not more.<br />\n&#8216;We must learn from the mistakes of the past \u2013- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.<br />\n&#8216;The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.<br />\n&#8216;America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.<br />\n&#8216;We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.<br />\n&#8216;Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.<br />\n&#8216;On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America&#8217;s centennial. At that celebration, the country&#8217;s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.<br />\n&#8216;Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.<br />\n&#8216;Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.<br />\n&#8216;Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.<br />\n&#8216;Imagine the wonders our country could know in America&#8217;s 250th year.<br />\n&#8216;Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.<br />\n&#8216;Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.<br />\n&#8216;American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.<br />\n&#8216;Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.<br />\n&#8216;And streets where mothers are safe from fear &#8212; schools where children learn in peace &#8212; and jobs where Americans prosper and grow &#8212; are not too much to ask.<br />\n&#8216;When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.<br />\n&#8216;This is our vision. This is our mission.<br />\n&#8216;But we can only get there together.<br />\n&#8216;We are one people, with one destiny.<br />\n&#8216;We all bleed the same blood.<br />\n&#8216;We all salute the same flag.<br />\n&#8216;And we are all made by the same God.<br />\n&#8216;And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.<br />\n&#8216;The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.<br />\n&#8216;We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.<br />\n&#8216;The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.<br />\n&#8216;And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.<br />\n&#8216;From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears \u2013- inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past \u2013- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.<br />\n&#8216;I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.

He also blasted Trump for green-lighting what he called the \u2018stupid mission\u2019 that claimed Ryan\u2019s life.\n\nBut the president praised Ryan as \u2018a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ryan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity\u2019 Trump said. \u2018For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom. We will never forget Ryan.\u2019\n\nTrump began Tuesday night with a claim on the role of political peacemaker, saying he wanted to bring Americans who voted for him together with those who didn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart,\u2019 he said.\n\nThat followed a stunning condemnation of anti-Semitism and other hatred.\n\nTrump declared that the close of Black History Month led him to remember \u2018our nation\u2019s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.\u2019\n\nRecent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\u2019s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\n\n\u2018Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\u2019s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\u2019\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s other rhetoric was full of hopeful Kennedyesque loft \u2013 notable after four contentious weeks marking the beginning of the president\u2019s Washington odyssey.\n\n\u2018Think of the marvels we can achieve,\u2019 Trump urged, speaking of his still-incubating science reform proposals, \u2018if we simply set free the dreams of our people, cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\u2019\n\n\u2018American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.\u2019\n\nTrump, 70, was predicting a safer and more prosperous world when America celebrates its 250th birthday in 2026. He noted the centennial celebrations in 1876 where \u2018the country\u2019s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations\u2019 in Philadelphia.\n\nDEMOCRATS LAUGHED, HISSED AND GASPED\n\nTrump made appeal after appeal for bipartisan cooperation, but Democrats were anything but unanimously receptive.\n\nSEAL HERO PRAISED\n\nRyan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom. We will never forget Ryan.\n\nTrump, paying tribute to Ryan Owens, a Navy SEAL who perished in a military operation late last month\n\nSome of them laughed out loud when the president bragged that he has \u2018begun to drain the swamp of government corruption.\u2019\n\nOthers gasped in audible disbelief when he announced the formation of a government department to assist victims of illegal-immigrant criminals.\n\nThen came the hissing when he announced that \u2018the time for trivial fights is behind us.\u2019\n\nDemocrats sat, arms folded, as he rattled off a laundry list of his supporters\u2019 red meat slogans \u2013 all with the usual panache.\n\n\u2018We will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border,\u2019 he said. \u2018It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.\u2019\n\nAnd he doubled down on efforts to pause admissions to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority nations where limited screening capacity has left question marks next to countless incoming travelers.\n\n\u2018It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur,\u2019 he said.\n\nDemocrats have already pilloried Trump through days of tumult as his White House endured an error-ridden rollout of his travel ban order.\n\nThey descended into Schadenfreude as the investigative saga of his campaign\u2019s alleged Moscow ties took on new and ever more threatening forms.\n\nThey mocked the Trump administration\u2019s leak-prone inner circle. They obstructed the confirmation calendar of his cabinet secretaries.\n\nThey clobbered the first outline of the president\u2019s budget priorities.\n\nThey were joined in that by some key Republicans.\n\nRED MEAT ON ISIS AND IMMIGRATION\n\nOn Tuesday they joined the GOP in applauding Trump\u2019s condemnation of the ISIS terror army as \u2018a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.\u2019\n\nThere was no such bipartisan appreciation when the president boomed the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019\n\nThe degree to which Trump has polarized Washington could be seen on the faces of lawmakers, and in the reactions of TV hosts Joe Scarborough and Sean Hannity. Both men were guests of congressmen.\n\nHannity, a Fox News conservative, applauded and roared as Trump outlined his agenda. MSNBC\u2019s Scarborough, a former Republican congressman who now mocks the White House daily, scowled and shook his head.\n\nTrump began Tuesday night with a claim on the role of political peacemaker, saying he wanted to bring Americans who voted for him together with those who didn\u2019t\n\n+51\n\nTrump began Tuesday night with a claim on the role of political peacemaker, saying he wanted to bring Americans who voted for him together with those who didn\u2019t\n\nTrump called on Tuesday for Congress to \u2018increase funding for our veterans,\u2019 pass \u2018historic tax reform\u2019 for middle-class Americans, make good on his campaign pledge to \u2018repeal and replace Obamacare,\u2019 help soften the financial burden of child care, and \u2018help ensure new parents have paid family leave.\u2019\n\nHis speech also included a demand that the government \u2018invest in women\u2019s health\u2019 and \u2018promote clean air and clean water and rebuild our military infrastructure.\u2019\n\nAnd Trump boasted that \u2018by finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s domestic policy prescriptions were led by his death prognosis for the Obamacare medical insurance overhaul experiment.\n\n\u2018Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do,\u2019 he pledged.\n\n\u2018Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken.\u2019\n\nTrump said he will support retaining one aspect of the Affordable Care Act, ensuring that patients with pre-existing medical conditions can\u2019t be denied insurance coverage.\n\nHe also demanded \u2018a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.\u2019\n\nNO BACKING DOWN: SCHOOL CHOICE AND DEPORTATIONS\n\nThe president challenged Congress to develop a plan that will use tax credits and \u2018Health Savings Accounts\u2019 to give Americans a broader choice of plans \u2013 including those offered by insurance companies in other states.\n\nTrump also planted a stake in the ground for school-choice advocates, saying that \u2018education is the civil rights issue of our time.\u2019\n\nHe asked Congress for an education bill \u2018that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.\u2019\n\n\u2018These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them,\u2019 he said.\n\nAnother dramatic moment came when he acknowledged Jamiel Shaw, the father of a 17-year-old boy who was \u2018viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.\u2019\n\nShaw, along with a group of \u2018Angel Moms\u2019 who lost children in similar attacks, was a fixture at Trump campaign rallies.\n\nNext to him sat the widows of two police officers \u2018gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.\u2019\n\nThe central philosophy of the president\u2019s economic and foreign policies is the \u2018America first\u2019 agenda he promised would guide him in his inauguration speech.\n\nSOLVE PROBLEMS AT HOME FIRST\n\nOn Tuesday he sat comfortably with that idea, making the case that the U.S. should look inward to enact some of the solutions it has spent generations\n\n\u2018For too long, we\u2019ve watched our middle class shrink as we\u2019ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit \u2013 and so many other places throughout our land.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross \u2014 and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.\n\n\u2018And we\u2019ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\u2019\n\nTrump painted his own political rise as the antidote, saying that last year \u2018the earth shifted beneath our feet\u2019 as a quiet conservative counter-culture became a \u2018loud chorus\u2019 and then a political \u2018earthquake\u2019 of millions who elected him.\n\nLater he declared that while \u2018America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path,\u2019 his own job is \u2018not to represent the world: My job is to represent the United States of America.\u2019\n\nMore members of Congress \u2013 including a nearly full complement of Democrats \u2013 heard Trump\u2019s message Tuesday in person than anything the brash billionaire had said previously.\n\nFIVE MINUTE OVATION AS HE ENTERED TO CHEERS\n\nFollowing a rash of Democratic boycotts of his January 20 inauguration, only one \u2013 Rep. Maxine Waters of California \u2013 announced that she would purposely skip Tuesday\u2019s speech.\n\nThe far-left partisan reportedly said during a Democratic Caucus meeting that any lawmaker \u2018who can\u2019t sit still shouldn\u2019t go.\u2019\n\nOthers, including New York Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, said they would attend but go out of their way to avoid shaking Trump\u2019s hand \u2013 something few members of Congress get close enough to do.\n\nTexas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee, known for hogging an aisle seat every time President Barack Obama delivered a State of the Union speech \u2013 the better to be seen on TV shaking his hand \u2013 said through a spokesman that she didn\u2019t plan to repeat the effort.\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell, another Democrat, was also fond of sitting on the aisle so he could share a few words with Obama once a year.\n\nBut as Trump turned the page and builds his own relationship with Congress, Pascrell told Fox News: \u2018I will not take an aisle seat.\u2019\n\nTrump entered the House chamber to raucous cheers from the GOP and polite claps from Democrats.\n\nHe pumped a fist, straightened his blue-and-white striped tie, and acknowledged more than five minutes of sustained applause. Another ovation came after House Speaker Paul Ryan pounded a ceremonial gavel and introduced him\n\nThe occasion of a president\u2019s first speech before the entire federal legislature and most of his cabinet \u2013 one member always stays away as a \u2018designated survivor\u2019 in case of the unthinkable \u2013 is a \u2018State of the Union\u2019 address in all but name.\n\nCAMPAIGN PLEDGE TO REPEAL OBAMACARE GETS FRESH AIRING\n\nOn Tuesday that honor went to Veterans Administration Secretary David Shulkin.\n\nTrump\u2019s main job Tuesday and in the days that follow is to give his administration a booster shot of enthusiasm.\n\nMany of the key issues in the president\u2019s stable, all campaign rally standards, had lost their luster in the corrosive air of government.\n\nHis once-rock-solid pledge to begin repealing and replacing Obamacare on the first day of his presidency ran into the buzz saw of internal Republican politics, with warring factions disagreeing about whether the two halves of the promise need to happen simultaneously.\n\nBernie Sanders was in high spirits as he greeted colleagues before the speech\n\n+51\n\nBernie Sanders was in high spirits as he greeted colleagues before the speech\n\nTrump\u2019s prepared remarks include a firm marker, however, demanding \u2018reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time provide better health care.\u2019\n\n\u2018Mandating every American to buy government approved health insurance was never the right solution for America,\u2019 Trump said.\n\n\u2018The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance and that is what we will do.\u2019\n\nTrump once vowed to rebuild America\u2019s \u2018decimated\u2019 military, but the reality of cutting $54 billion per year from domestic spending to pay for it has drawn jaundiced stares on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle.\n\nEven his signature issue \u2013 illegal immigration \u2013 has seen the Trumpian bravado quieted into a quietly whispered cascade of maybes.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon multiple sources in a lunch meeting the president held with television anchors said he made an overture to Democrats about an immigration reform proposal.\n\n\u2018The time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides,\u2019 he reportedly said.\n\nThose words hung in the Washington air for hours on Tuesday as pundits and lawmakers alike wondered if Trump was ready to embrace the kind of \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 compromise he mocked during the Republican primary season.\n\nA law offering some illegal immigrants a pathway to legal status \u2013 or even citizenship \u2013 was the sort of sausage-making that made Marco Rubio\u2019s path to the White House impossibly fraught.\n\nMELANIA GETS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT\n\nHis first move may be to lower the bar for so-called \u2018DREAMers,\u2019 people illegally brought to the U.S. years ago when they were children.\n\nTrump called their situation \u2018very, very difficult\u2019 during a press conference just a dozen days ago.\n\n\u2018To me, it\u2019s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids \u2026 they were brought in here in such a way. It\u2019s a very, very tough subject,\u2019 he said, while emphasizing that some of them have turned criminal and should be deported.\n\nThe president\u2019s campaign persona emphasized a one-size-fits-all approach, saying last August that every illegal immigrant would have \u2018to return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else,\u2019 as part of his bid to \u2018break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration.\n\nThere is a long tradition of the party out of power sitting out applause lines thrown at them by the president during a speech they are forced to watch on camera.\n\nDemocrats on Tuesday took their opposition to a new level. When the president got announced and entered the chamber, dozens of Democrats stood, but kept blank expressions on their faces and refrained from clapping.\n\nEven when Trump made non-controversial statements about lowering prescription drug costs, many Democrats sat on their hands.\n\nThere were a few holdovers from the traditional theater that comes with the speech.\n\nWhen First Lady Melania Trump first entered the chamber \u2013 after an awkward interlude where she stood without waving \u2013 the chamber erupted into a big round of applause with approving yells.\n\n\u2018Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America:\n\n\u2018Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation\u2019s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\u2019s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\n\n\u2018Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice \u2013- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.\n\n\u2018That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\n\n\u2018A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.\n\n\u2018A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.\n\n\u2018And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.\n\n\u2018What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.\n\n\u2018Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.\n\n\u2018All the nations of the world \u2014 friend or foe \u2014 will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.\n\n\u2018In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding \u2014 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.\n\n\u2018It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.\n\n\u2018But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?\n\n\u2018I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.\n\n\u2018For too long, we\u2019ve watched our middle class shrink as we\u2019ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit \u2014 and so many other places throughout our land.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross \u2014 and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.\n\n\u2018And we\u2019ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\n\n\u2018Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -\u2013 families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.\n\n\u2018But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus \u2014 as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\n\n\u2018Finally, the chorus became an earthquake \u2013 and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first \u2026 because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\n\n\u2018Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.\n\n\u2018Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\n\n\u2018Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.\n\n\u2018Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.\n\n\u2018And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.\n\n\u2018Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I\u2019ve made in keeping those promises.\n\n\u2018Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\n\n\u2018The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We\u2019ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.\n\n\u2018We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials \u2013- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\n\n\u2018We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.\n\n\u2018We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines \u2014 thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs \u2014 and I\u2019ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.\n\n\u2018We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\n\u2018With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\n\n\u2018To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.\n\n\u2018I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.\n\n\u2018We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth \u2014 and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\n\n\u2018At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed \u2013- but that can\u2019t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.\n\n\u2018For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.\n\n\u2018As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.\n\n\u2018To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\n\n\u2018Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\n\u2018According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home -\u2013 from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.\n\n\u2018We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.\n\n\u2018It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.\n\n\u2018We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America \u2014 we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\n\n\u2018That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe \u2014 and to keep out those who would do us harm.\n\n\u2018As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS \u2014 a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\n\n\u2018I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.\n\n\u2018Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court \u2014 from my list of 20 judges \u2014 who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\n\n\u2018Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.\n\n\u2018Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.\n\n\u2018Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.\n\n\u2018More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.\n\n\u2018We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.\n\n\u2018In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we\u2019ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\n\n\u2018Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.\n\n\u2018And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\n\n\u2018Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.\n\n\u2018But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy \u2014 making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.\n\n\u2018Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.\n\n\u2018My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.\n\n\u2018We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.\n\n\u2018Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes \u2014 but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.\n\n\u2018I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.\n\n\u2018At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it\u2019s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me \u2014 without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it \u2014 that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.\n\n\u2018They weren\u2019t even asking for change. But I am.\n\n\u2018I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.\n\n\u2018The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the \u201cabandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d\n\n\u2018Lincoln was right \u2014 and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.\n\n\u2018I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\n\n\u2018Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others \u2013- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America\u2019s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\n\n\u2018Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers\u2019 wages, and help struggling families \u2013- including immigrant families \u2013- enter the middle class.\n\n\u2018I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\u2019s security, and to restore respect for our laws.\n\n\u2018If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\n\n\u2018Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program \u2013- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\n\n\u2018America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country \u2013- twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\n\n\u2018To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States \u2014 financed through both public and private capital \u2013- creating millions of new jobs.\n\n\u2018This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.\n\n\u2018Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.\n\n\u2018Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.\n\n\u2018Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State \u2014 it is unsustainable and collapsing.\n\n\u2018One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges \u2013- leaving many Americans with no choice at all.\n\n\u2018Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?\n\n\u2018We now know that all of those promises have been broken.\n\n\u2018Obamacare is collapsing \u2013- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice \u2013- it is a necessity.\n\n\u2018So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\n\n\u2018Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:\n\n\u2018First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.\n\n\u2018Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts \u2013- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.\n\n\u2018Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\n\n\u2018Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance \u2013 and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\n\n\u2018Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines \u2013- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.\n\n\u2018Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.\n\n\u2018Our citizens deserve this, and so much more \u2013- so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.\n\n\u2018My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women\u2019s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\n\n\u2018True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.\n\n\u2018An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.\n\n\u2018Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.\n\n\u2018On receiving this news, Megan\u2019s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\u2019s life. Today she is 20 years old \u2014 and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\n\n\u2018Megan\u2019s story is about the unbounded power of a father\u2019s love for a daughter.\n\n\u2018But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\u2019s life, from reaching those in need.\n\n\u2018If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.\n\n\u2018In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.\n\n\u2018But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind \u2013- and the souls \u2013- of every American child.\n\n\u2018Education is the civil rights issue of our time.\n\n\u2018I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\n\n\u2018Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.\n\n\u2018We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\n\n\u2018But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\n\n\u2018The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.\n\n\u2018In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone \u2013- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.\n\n\u2018This is not acceptable in our society.\n\n\u2018Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.\n\n\u2018But to create this future, we must work with \u2013- not against -\u2013 the men and women of law enforcement.\n\n\u2018We must build bridges of cooperation and trust \u2013- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.\n\n\u2018Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters \u2013 and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they\u2019ll come home safe and sound.\n\n\u2018We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\n\n\u2018And we must support the victims of crime.\n\n\u2018I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE \u2013- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.\n\n\u2018Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.\n\n\u2018Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\n\n\u2018Jamiel\u2019s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.\n\n\u2018Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands \u2013- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis \u2013- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.\n\n\u2018Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\n\n\u2018To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know \u2013- we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.\n\n\u2018Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and \u2013- if they must \u2013- to fight and to win.\n\n\u2018I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\n\n\u2018My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.\n\n\u2018Our veterans have delivered for this Nation \u2013- and now we must deliver for them.\n\n\u2018The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.\n\n\u2018And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\n\n\u2018We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero \u2013- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.\n\n\u2018I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \u201cRyan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\u201d Ryan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom \u2013- we will never forget him.\n\n\u2018To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.\n\n\u2018Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.\n\n\u2018We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.\n\n\u2018But our partners must meet their financial obligations.\n\n\u2018And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\n\n\u2018We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific \u2013- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.\n\n\u2018We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.\n\n\u2018Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people \u2013- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict \u2014 not more.\n\n\u2018We must learn from the mistakes of the past \u2013- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.\n\n\u2018The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.\n\n\u2018America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\n\n\u2018We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\n\n\u2018Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.\n\n\u2018On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America\u2019s centennial. At that celebration, the country\u2019s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.\n\n\u2018Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\n\n\u2018Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.\n\n\u2018Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.\n\n\u2018Imagine the wonders our country could know in America\u2019s 250th year.\n\n\u2018Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.\n\n\u2018Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\n\n\u2018American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\n\n\u2018Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.\n\n\u2018And streets where mothers are safe from fear \u2014 schools where children learn in peace \u2014 and jobs where Americans prosper and grow \u2014 are not too much to ask.\n\n\u2018When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.\n\n\u2018This is our vision. This is our mission.\n\n\u2018But we can only get there together.\n\n\u2018We are one people, with one destiny.\n\n\u2018We all bleed the same blood.\n\n\u2018We all salute the same flag.\n\n\u2018And we are all made by the same God.\n\n\u2018And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.\n\n\u2018The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.\n\n\u2018We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.\n\n\u2018The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.\n\n\u2018And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.\n\n\u2018From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears \u2013- inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past \u2013- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\n\n\u2018I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and \u2014\n\n\u2018Believe in yourselves.\n\n\u2018Believe in your future.\n\n\u2018And believe, once more, in America.\n\n\u2018Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States.\u2019\n\nRead more:
