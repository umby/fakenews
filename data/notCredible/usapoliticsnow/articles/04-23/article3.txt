and promising an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the New World Order are making the necessary preparations to completely and utterly obliterate every single Republican\u00a0plan.</strong></p>\n<p>Forgot about halting construction of Trump\u2019s wall. Soros won\u2019t be happy until every map of the U.S. is free of borders, migrants outnumber patriots, the White House is torched, and we are governed by a totalitarian one-world government who continue to hate us even though we don\u2019t have freedoms anymore.</p>\n<p>Soros is doing this the only way he knows how \u2013 by throwing his dirty money around, sponsoring hate groups, protestors, and NGOS, attempting to subvert the course of democracy and eradicate the silent majority.</p>\n<p>We can reveal the names of 187 groups directly funded by George Soros in his attempt to destroy America.</p>\n<p>Some of the names on this list will shock you\u2026Abortion groups, open borders advocates, immigrant activists, groups to change the way we vote, socialist\u00a0health care, climate change, \u201cCatholics\u201d, Socialists and Communists.</p>\n<p>Soros actually has a group whose stated goal is to take money from rich Jews and give it to\u00a0those with less.\u00a0Considering a\u00a0video interview exists of\u00a0George Soros (a Jew) admitting that he helped the Nazis confiscate property from Jews\u00a0during WWII,\u00a0the idea that Soros is\u00a0funding such a group is not really so stunning.</p>\n<p>Truth &amp; Acton <a href=\"http://www.truthandaction.org/donald-trump-attack-187-organizations-funded-george-soros/\">report</a>: They\u2019re all here. 187 groups being used to destroy America, thanks to funding by billionaire George Soros. Here are the groups who are using Trump\u2019s election as an excuse to take down America:</p>\n<p><strong>Advancement Project:</strong> This organization works to organize \u201ccommunities of color\u201d into politically cohesive units while disseminating its leftist worldviews and values as broadly as possible by way of a sophisticated communications department.</p>\n<p><strong>Air America Radio</strong>: Now defunct, this was a self-identified \u201cliberal\u201d radio network.</p>\n<p><strong>All of Us or None</strong>: This organization seeks to change voting laws \u2014 which vary from state to state \u2014 so as to allow ex-inmates, parolees, and even current inmates to cast their ballots in political elections.</p>\n<p><strong>Alliance for Justice</strong>: Best known for its activism vis a vis the appointment of federal judges, this group consistently depicts Republican judicial nominees as \u201cextremists.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>America Coming Together</strong>: Soros played a major role in creating this group, whose purpose was to coordinate and organize pro-Democrat voter-mobilization programs.</p>\n<p><strong>America Votes</strong>: Soros also played a major role in creating this group, whose get-out-the-vote campaigns targeted likely Democratic voters.</p>\n<p><strong>America\u2019s Voice</strong>: This open-borders group seeks to promote \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration reform that includes a robust agenda in favor of amnesty for illegal aliens.</p>\n<p><strong>American Bar Association Commission on Immigration Policy</strong>: This organization \u201copposes laws that require employers and persons providing education, health care, or other social services to verify citizenship or immigration status.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>American Bridge 21st Century:</strong> This Super PAC conducts opposition research designed to help Democratic political candidates defeat their Republican foes.</p>\n<p><strong>American Civil Liberties Union:</strong> This group opposes virtually all post-9/11 national security measures enacted by the U.S. government. It supports open borders, has rushed to the defense of suspected terrorists and their abettors, and appointed former New Left terrorist Bernardine Dohrn to its Advisory Board.</p>\n<p><strong>American Constitution Society for Law and Policy:</strong> This Washington, DC-based think tank seeks to move American jurisprudence to the left by recruiting, indoctrinating, and mobilizing young law students, helping them acquire positions of power. It also provides leftist Democrats with a bully pulpit from which to denounce their political adversaries.</p>\n<p><strong>American Family Voices</strong>: This group creates and coordinates media campaigns charging Republicans with wrongdoing.</p>\n<p><strong>American Federation of Teachers:</strong> After longtime AFT President Albert Shanker died in in 1997, he was succeeded by Sandra Feldman, who slowly \u201cre-branded\u201d the union, allying it with some of the most powerful left-wing elements of the New Labor Movement. When Feldman died in 2004, Edward McElroy took her place, followed by Randi Weingarten in 2008. All of them kept the union on the leftward course it had adopted in its post-Shanker period.</p>\n<p><strong>American Friends Service Committee:</strong> This group views the United States as the principal cause of human suffering around the world.

"http://usapoliticsnow.com/breaking-america-attack-187-groups-funded-george-soros/", "date": "04-23-2017", "source": "usapoliticsnow", "text": "Notorious globalist billionaire George Soros has gone on the record threatening to \u201ctake down President Trump\u201d and promising an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the New World Order are making the necessary preparations to completely and utterly obliterate every single Republican plan.\n\nForgot about halting construction of Trump\u2019s wall. Soros won\u2019t be happy until every map of the U.S. is free of borders, migrants outnumber patriots, the White House is torched, and we are governed by a totalitarian one-world government who continue to hate us even though we don\u2019t have freedoms anymore.\n\nSoros is doing this the only way he knows how \u2013 by throwing his dirty money around, sponsoring hate groups, protestors, and NGOS, attempting to subvert the course of democracy and eradicate the silent majority.\n\nWe can reveal the names of 187 groups directly funded by George Soros in his attempt to destroy America.\n\nSome of the names on this list will shock you\u2026Abortion groups, open borders advocates, immigrant activists, groups to change the way we vote, socialist health care, climate change, \u201cCatholics\u201d, Socialists and Communists.\n\nSoros actually has a group whose stated goal is to take money from rich Jews and give it to those with less. Considering a video interview exists of George Soros (a Jew) admitting that he helped the Nazis confiscate property from Jews during WWII, the idea that Soros is funding such a group is not really so stunning.\n\nTruth & Acton report: They\u2019re all here. 187 groups being used to destroy America, thanks to funding by billionaire George Soros. Here are the groups who are using Trump\u2019s election as an excuse to take down America:\n\nAdvancement Project: This organization works to organize \u201ccommunities of color\u201d into politically cohesive units while disseminating its leftist worldviews and values as broadly as possible by way of a sophisticated communications department.\n\nAir America Radio: Now defunct, this was a self-identified \u201cliberal\u201d radio network.\n\nAll of Us or None: This organization seeks to change voting laws \u2014 which vary from state to state \u2014 so as to allow ex-inmates, parolees, and even current inmates to cast their ballots in political elections.\n\nAlliance for Justice: Best known for its activism vis a vis the appointment of federal judges, this group consistently depicts Republican judicial nominees as \u201cextremists.\u201d\n\nAmerica Coming Together: Soros played a major role in creating this group, whose purpose was to coordinate and organize pro-Democrat voter-mobilization programs.\n\nAmerica Votes: Soros also played a major role in creating this group, whose get-out-the-vote campaigns targeted likely Democratic voters.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Voice: This open-borders group seeks to promote \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration reform that includes a robust agenda in favor of amnesty for illegal aliens.\n\nAmerican Bar Association Commission on Immigration Policy: This organization \u201copposes laws that require employers and persons providing education, health care, or other social services to verify citizenship or immigration status.\u201d\n\nAmerican Bridge 21st Century: This Super PAC conducts opposition research designed to help Democratic political candidates defeat their Republican foes.\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union: This group opposes virtually all post-9/11 national security measures enacted by the U.S. government. It supports open borders, has rushed to the defense of suspected terrorists and their abettors, and appointed former New Left terrorist Bernardine Dohrn to its Advisory Board.\n\nAmerican Constitution Society for Law and Policy: This Washington, DC-based think tank seeks to move American jurisprudence to the left by recruiting, indoctrinating, and mobilizing young law students, helping them acquire positions of power. It also provides leftist Democrats with a bully pulpit from which to denounce their political adversaries.\n\nAmerican Family Voices: This group creates and coordinates media campaigns charging Republicans with wrongdoing.\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers: After longtime AFT President Albert Shanker died in in 1997, he was succeeded by Sandra Feldman, who slowly \u201cre-branded\u201d the union, allying it with some of the most powerful left-wing elements of the New Labor Movement. When Feldman died in 2004, Edward McElroy took her place, followed by Randi Weingarten in 2008. All of them kept the union on the leftward course it had adopted in its post-Shanker period.\n\nAmerican Friends Service Committee: This group views the United States as the principal cause of human suffering around the world. As such, it favors America\u2019s unilateral disarmament, the dissolution of American borders, amnesty for illegal aliens, the abolition of the death penalty, and the repeal of the Patriot Act.\n\nAmerican Immigration Council: This non-profit organization is a prominent member of the open-borders lobby.

These initiatives have been notoriously marred by fraud and corruption.\n\nBallot Initiative Strategy Center: This organization seeks to advance \u201ca national progressive strategy\u201d by means of ballot measures\u2014state-level legislative proposals that pass successfully through a petition (\u201cinitiative\u201d) process and are then voted upon by the public.\n\nBill of Rights Defense Committee: This group provides a detailed blueprint for activists interested in getting their local towns, cities, and even college campuses to publicly declare their opposition to the Patriot Act, and to designate themselves \u201cCivil Liberties Safe Zones.\u201d The organization also came to the defense of self-described radical attorney Lynne Stewart, who was convicted in 2005 of providing material support for terrorism.\n\nBlack Alliance for Just Immigration: This organization seeks to create a unified movement for \u201csocial and economic justice\u201d centered on black racial identity.\n\nBlueprint North Carolina: This group seeks to \u201cinfluence state policy in North Carolina so that residents of the state benefit from more progressive policies such as better access to health care, higher wages, more affordable housing, a safer, cleaner environment, and access to reproductive health services.\u201d\n\nBrennan Center for Justice: This think tank/legal activist group generates scholarly studies, mounts media campaigns, files amicus briefs, gives pro bono support to activists, and litigates test cases in pursuit of radical \u201cchange.\u201d\n\nBrookings Institution: This organization has been involved with a variety of internationalist and state-sponsored programs, including one that aspires to facilitate the establishment of a U.N.-dominated world government. Brookings Fellows have also called for additional global collaboration on trade and banking; the expansion of the Kyoto Protocol; and nationalized health insurance for children. Nine Brookings economists signed a petition opposing President Bush\u2019s tax cuts in 2003.\n\nCampaign for America\u2019s Future: This group supports tax hikes, socialized medicine, and a dramatic expansion of social welfare programs.\n\nCampaign for Better Health Care: This organization favors a single-payer, government-run, universal health care system.\n\nCampaign for Youth Justice: This organization contends that \u201ctransferring juveniles to the adult criminal-justice system leads to higher rates of recidivism, puts incarcerated and detained youth at unnecessary risk, has little deterrence value, and does not increase public safety.\u201d\n\nCampus Progress: A project of the Soros-bankrolled Center for American Progress, this group seeks to \u201cstrengthen progressive voices on college and university campuses, counter the growing influence of right-wing groups on campus, and empower new generations of progressive leaders.\u201d\n\nCasa de Maryland: This organization aggressively lobbies legislators to vote in favor of policies that promote expanded rights, including amnesty, for illegal aliens currently residing in the United States.\n\nCatalist: This is a for-profit political consultancy that seeks \u201cto help progressive organizations realize measurable increases in civic participation and electoral success by building and operating a robust national voter database of every voting-age American.\u201d\n\nCatholics for Choice: This nominally Catholic organization supports women\u2019s right to abortion-on-demand.\n\nCatholics in Alliance for the Common Good: This political nonprofit group is dedicated to generating support from the Catholic community for leftwing candidates, causes, and legislation.\n\nCenter for American Progress: This leftist think tank is headed by former Clinton chief of staff John Podesta, works closely with Hillary Clinton, and employs numerous former Clinton administration staffers. It is committed to \u201cdeveloping a long-term vision of a progressive America\u201d and \u201cproviding a forum to generate new progressive ideas and policy proposals.\u201d\n\nCenter for Community Change: This group recruits and trains activists to spearhead leftist \u201cpolitical issue campaigns.\u201d Promoting increased funding for social welfare programs by bringing \u201cattention to major national issues related to poverty,\u201d the Center bases its training programs on the techniques taught by the famed radical organizer Saul Alinsky.\n\nCenter for Constitutional Rights: This pro-Castro organization is a core member of the open borders lobby, has opposed virtually all post-9/11 anti-terrorism measures by the U.S. government, and alleges that American injustice provokes acts of international terrorism.\n\nCenter for Economic and Policy Research: This group opposed welfare reform, supports \u201cliving wage\u201d laws, rejects tax cuts, and consistently lauds the professed achievements of socialist regimes, most notably Venezuela.\n\nCenter for Reproductive Rights: CRR\u2019s mission is to guarantee safe, affordable contraception and abortion-on-demand for all women, including adolescents. The organization has filed state and federal lawsuits demanding access to taxpayer-funded abortions (through Medicaid) for low-income women.\n\nCenter for Responsible Lending: This organization was a major player in the subprime mortgage crisis. According to Phil Kerpen (vice president for policy at Americans for Prosperity), CRL \u201csh[ook] down and harass[ed] banks into making bad loans to unqualified borrowers.\u201d Moreover, CRL negotiated a contract enabling it to operate as a conduit of high-risk loans to Fannie Mae.\n\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities: Reasoning from the premise that tax cuts generally help only the wealthy, this organization advocates greater tax expenditures on social welfare programs for low earners.\n\nCenter on Wisconsin Strategy (COWS): Aiming to redistribute wealth by way of higher taxes imposed on those whose incomes are above average, COWS contends that \u201cit is important that state government be able to harness fair contribution from all parts of society \u2013 including corporations and the wealthy.\u201d\n\nChange America Now: Formed in December 2006, Change America Now describes itself as \u201can independent political organization created to educate citizens on the failed policies of the Republican Congress and to contrast that record of failure with the promise offered by a Democratic agenda.\u201d\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington: This group litigates and brings ethics charges against \u201cgovernment officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests\u201d and \u201cbetray the public trust.\u201d Almost all of its targets are Republicans.\n\nCoalition for an International Criminal Court: This group seeks to subordinate American criminal-justice procedures to those of an international court.\n\nCommon Cause: This organization aims to bring about campaign-finance reform, pursue media reform resembling the Fairness Doctrine, and cut military budgets in favor of increased social-welfare and environmental spending.\n\nConstitution Project: This organization seeks to challenge the legality of military commissions; end the detainment of \u201cenemy combatants\u201d; condemn government surveillance of terrorists; and limit the President\u2019s executive privileges.\n\nDefenders of Wildlife Action Fund: Defenders of Wildlife opposes oil exploration in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It condemns logging, ranching, mining, and even the use of recreational motorized vehicles as activities that are destructive to the environment.\n\nDemocracy Alliance: This self-described \u201cliberal organization\u201d aims to raise $200 million to develop a funding clearinghouse for leftist groups. Soros is a major donor to this group.\n\nDemocracy 21: This group is a staunch supporter of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, also known as the McCain-Feingold Act.\n\nDemocracy Now!: Democracy Now! was created in 1996 by WBAI radio news director Amy Goodman and four partners to provide \u201cperspectives rarely heard in the U.S. corporate-sponsored media,\u201d i.e., the views of radical and foreign journalists, left and labor activists, and ideological foes of capitalism.\n\nDemocratic Justice Fund: DJF opposes the Patriot Act and most efforts to restrict or regulate immigration into the United States \u2014 particularly from countries designated by the State Department as \u201cterrorist nations.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Party: Soros\u2019 funding activities are devoted largely to helping the Democratic Party solidify its power base.
