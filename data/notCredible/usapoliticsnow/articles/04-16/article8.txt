recently has sparked one yet another Obama controversy. Why was there chemical weapons in Syria? You see, back in 2014, then Secretary of State John Kerry had come out to the public and claimed that a deal had been struck, and that deal included <a href=\"http://www.hannity.com/articles/election-493995/stunning-admission-obama-aide-says-they-15724896/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Syria </a>revealing and giving up its chemical weapons for good.</p>\n<p>The left was so proud of their accomplishment. Indeed, the Democrats and the Obama administration \u2013 even the press \u2013<br />\ncould do nothing short of self-congratulating themselves over and over on every news media outlet. They threw it in the face of the right and touted that this was yet another of President Obama\u2019s many accomplishments.</p>\n<p>I mean, the man took out Bin Laden!</p>\n<p>\u2026But that is where the congratulatory effort ends. As it turns out, a leak from the Obama administration has come forward with some disconcerting news. This official that served in the administration has claimed that they \u201calways knew\u201d Assad still had access to chemical weapons \u2013 even with their multiple statements of success in confiscating them all.</p>\n<p>Tony Blinken was a former deputy secretary of state in Obama\u2019s administration. He was also Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser. Blinken told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/09/us/politics/obama-syria-chemical-weapons.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York Times</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWe always knew we had not gotten everything, that the Syrians had not been fully forthcoming in their declaration.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>It was only back in 2014 that Politifact, the fact-checking website, had taken Kerry\u2019s claims and did their own background investigation. What did they find? PolitiFact ruled Kerry\u2019s claim \u201cmostly true.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cKerry said all of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons had been removed. The UN body in charge said that the last of Syria\u2019s declared chemical weapons left the country in late June. There remain, however, some discrepancies in the details of the weapons the Syrians had acknowledged possessing, and some additional work is needed,\u201d they said at the time. \u201cWith that qualification, we rate the claim Mostly True.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>\u2026Now as you can tell, the statement made up to this point are not true. At all. John Kerry back in 2014 and Susan Rice in January of 2017, had both confirmed that the chemicals weapons were no longer in the Syrian regime\u2019s hands. According to them, Assad had succumbed to the pressure put to him by the international community to give up his chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>Susan Rice had been on the left\u2019s favorite program, NPR, to give them assurance:</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWe were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>The strike that was conducted under the Trump administration had a tremendous effect, not only on Syria but also other countries who will not be named\u2026Okay, fine, North Korea! It was a sign of strength, and a signal that was loud and clear: We\u2019re back.</p>\n<p>According to the American Interest:</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cIf this strike was arranged to avoid hitting sarin storage facilities, the question arises: did the Obama Administration know that such depots still existed after its \u201chistoric\u201d deal that supposedly removed all Syria\u2019s chemical weapons?\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cThe signs point to yes. In Congressional testimony last February, Obama\u2019s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper acknowledged \u201cgaps and inconsistencies in Syria\u2019s declaration,\u201d validating reports that Syria was still hiding banned chemicals at undisclosed locations. And on its way out the door in January of this year, the Obama Treasury quietly introduced new sanctions against Syrian officials involved in chemical warfare. Buried in the language sanctioning a particular official was a telling admission: \u2018As of 2016, Abbas has continued operating at locations in Syria associated with chemical warfare-related missions.&#8217;\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWhether or not the Obama Administration knew of this particular sarin facility, then, they clearly knew that Syrians were still clinging to their stockpiles at several locations.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Gone are the days of false red lines and weakness. Many on the left, even those that served under the Obama administration have praised the move by Trump and even thanked him. Like Anne-Marie Slaughter, and official from Obama\u2019s time. She expressed it on her twitter page.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Donald Trump has done the right thing on Syria. Finally!! After years of useless handwringing in the face of hideous atrocities.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Anne-Marie Slaughter (@SlaughterAM) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SlaughterAM/status/850263058756673540\">April 7, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>At least 70 people \u2013 men, women, and children \u2013 were slaughtered without any remorse by the regime, and for what? What possible good could this have done? Nothing. It\u2019s brought down the condemnation of the world on the Assad regime, and also brought down 59 bombs. So far the conflict in Syria has been raging for six year, with no sign of stopping. The red lines drawn by Obama were as useless and pathetic then as they are now.</p>\n<p>There will be no more drawing of lines, not with this administration. I think it\u2019s safe to say that with the folks that President Trump has appointed \u2013 McMaster and Mattis \u2013 to lead our defenses, we are in good hands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div

Why was there chemical weapons in Syria? You see, back in 2014, then Secretary of State John Kerry had come out to the public and claimed that a deal had been struck, and that deal included Syria revealing and giving up its chemical weapons for good.\n\nThe left was so proud of their accomplishment. Indeed, the Democrats and the Obama administration \u2013 even the press \u2013\n\ncould do nothing short of self-congratulating themselves over and over on every news media outlet. They threw it in the face of the right and touted that this was yet another of President Obama\u2019s many accomplishments.\n\nI mean, the man took out Bin Laden!\n\n\u2026But that is where the congratulatory effort ends. As it turns out, a leak from the Obama administration has come forward with some disconcerting news. This official that served in the administration has claimed that they \u201calways knew\u201d Assad still had access to chemical weapons \u2013 even with their multiple statements of success in confiscating them all.\n\nTony Blinken was a former deputy secretary of state in Obama\u2019s administration. He was also Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser. Blinken told the New York Times:\n\n\u201cWe always knew we had not gotten everything, that the Syrians had not been fully forthcoming in their declaration.\u201d\n\nIt was only back in 2014 that Politifact, the fact-checking website, had taken Kerry\u2019s claims and did their own background investigation. What did they find? PolitiFact ruled Kerry\u2019s claim \u201cmostly true.\u201d\n\n\u201cKerry said all of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons had been removed. The UN body in charge said that the last of Syria\u2019s declared chemical weapons left the country in late June. There remain, however, some discrepancies in the details of the weapons the Syrians had acknowledged possessing, and some additional work is needed,\u201d they said at the time. \u201cWith that qualification, we rate the claim Mostly True.\u201d\n\n\u2026Now as you can tell, the statement made up to this point are not true. At all. John Kerry back in 2014 and Susan Rice in January of 2017, had both confirmed that the chemicals weapons were no longer in the Syrian regime\u2019s hands. According to them, Assad had succumbed to the pressure put to him by the international community to give up his chemical weapons.\n\nSusan Rice had been on the left\u2019s favorite program, NPR, to give them assurance:\n\n\u201cWe were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile.\u201d\n\nThe strike that was conducted under the Trump administration had a tremendous effect, not only on Syria but also other countries who will not be named\u2026Okay, fine, North Korea! It was a sign of strength, and a signal that was loud and clear: We\u2019re back.\n\nAccording to the American Interest:\n\n\u201cIf this strike was arranged to avoid hitting sarin storage facilities, the question arises: did the Obama Administration know that such depots still existed after its \u201chistoric\u201d deal that supposedly removed all Syria\u2019s chemical weapons?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe signs point to yes. In Congressional testimony last February, Obama\u2019s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper acknowledged \u201cgaps and inconsistencies in Syria\u2019s declaration,\u201d validating reports that Syria was still hiding banned chemicals at undisclosed locations. And on its way out the door in January of this year, the Obama Treasury quietly introduced new sanctions against Syrian officials involved in chemical warfare. Buried in the language sanctioning a particular official was a telling admission: \u2018As of 2016, Abbas has continued operating at locations in Syria associated with chemical warfare-related missions.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether or not the Obama Administration knew of this particular sarin facility, then, they clearly knew that Syrians were still clinging to their stockpiles at several locations.\u201d\n\nGone are the days of false red lines and weakness. Many on the left, even those that served under the Obama administration have praised the move by Trump and even thanked him. Like Anne-Marie Slaughter, and official from Obama\u2019s time. She expressed it on her twitter page.\n\nDonald Trump has done the right thing on Syria. Finally!! After years of useless handwringing in the face of hideous atrocities. \u2014 Anne-Marie Slaughter (@SlaughterAM) April 7, 2017\n\nAt least 70 people \u2013 men, women, and children \u2013 were slaughtered without any remorse by the regime, and for what? What possible good could this have done? Nothing. It\u2019s brought down the condemnation of the world on the Assad regime, and also brought down 59 bombs. So far the conflict in Syria has been raging for six year, with no sign of stopping. The red lines drawn by Obama were as useless and pathetic then as they are now.\n\nThere will be no more drawing of lines, not with this administration. I think it\u2019s safe to say that with the folks that President Trump has appointed \u2013 McMaster and Mattis \u2013 to lead our defenses, we are in good hands.", "images": ["http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Barack-Obama-and-John-Kerry-compressed.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kim2-compressed-100x100.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/themes/viral/images/shadow.png", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f-40-820x513-100x100.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-cropped-usalojko-2-1.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BREAKINGNEWS.png", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Barack-Obama-and-John-Kerry-compressed-100x100.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/police-100x100.jpg"], "videos": []}
