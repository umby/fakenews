A man with many identities. A \u201cbirth certificate\u201d suddenly appeared from Hawaii dated April 25, 2011. However, there is not a single midwife or doctor in all of Hawaii who remembers helping Ann Stanley to bring Hussein into this world. Reports indicate that Ann Stanley returned to Hawaii about three years after Obama\u2019s birth in Kenya and tried to register his birth as a US birth. In those days a birth did not need to be registered right after birth. A parent had to register a child\u2019s birth within three years.</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/i613.photobucket.com/albums/tt216/LogicWings/mombasa_copy.jpg\" alt=\"https://i1.wp.com/i613.photobucket.com/albums/tt216/LogicWings/mombasa_copy.jpg\" width=\"762\" height=\"660\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Certified copy of Registration of Birth from Kenya, dated 17th of February 1964 and signed by Deputy Registrar Joshua Sioon Couya. This is a copy of an original that had been signed by Registrar E.F Lavender on 5th of August in 1961.<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Obama hasn\u2019t met and doesn\u2019t meet the basic qualifications for the presidency \u2013 must be natural born citizen.</p>\n<p>Obama has been named in dozens of civil lawsuits alleging he is not eligible to be president, with many filing a criminal complaint alleging the commander-in-chief is a fraud.</p>\n<p>The filed indictments disputes Obama\u2019s eligibility to be president under the U.S. Constitution which requires that eligible candidates for the United States presidency be \u201cnatural born\u201d citizens.</p>\n<p>U.S. soldiers including a general refuse to recognize Obama as their Commander in Chief since he is not a U.S. citizen. The soldiers have challenged Obama\u2019s legitimacy by filing federal lawsuits against Obama.</p>\n<p>On such soldier was U.S. Army Maj. Stefan Frederick Cook who was given orders to deploy to Afghanistan. Cook refused to deploy stating that he shouldn\u2019t have to go because Obama is not a U.S. citizen and therefore not legally President and Commander in Chief.\u00a0 The military revoked the orders with no reason given.\u00a0 Speculation is that Obama would rather not see this thing go to court before a judge!</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the 20-page document \u2014 filed with the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia \u2014 the California-based Taitz asks the court to consider granting his client\u2019s request based upon Cook\u2019s belief that Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the United States and is therefore ineligible to serve as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces,\u201d the Ledger-Enquirer reported.</p>\n<p>Cook \u201cwould be acting in violation of international law by engaging in military actions outside the United States under this President\u2019s command. \u2026 simultaneously subjecting himself to possible prosecution as a war criminal by the faithful execution of these duties,\u201d Taitz stated.</p>\n<p>Obama says he was born in Hawaii in 1961, just two years after it became a state.</p>\n<p>There are many lawsuits and claims that Barack Obama was never eligible to be president because he wasn\u2019t born in the United States. And there is credible evidence that suggests he is not legally eligible to serve as President of the United States.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/29/local/me-oxy29\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Occidental recalls Barry Obama\" src=\"https://themuslimissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/94ee8-obama_lat_012907.jpg?w=566&amp;h=426\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"426\" /></a><br />\n<strong>Newspaper print of LA Times \u2013 Occidental recalls \u2018Barry\u2019 Obama.

How would Miriam Goderich come up with a \u2018mistake\u2019 like that unless she was told by Obama himself that he was born in Kenya, which is confirmed by the birth certificate and the school records from Indonesia.<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>Numerous official government documents records Obama being legally registered as Barry Soetoro. School registries shows the registration of Barack Obama under the name Barry Soetoro. During his Occidental College days he is registered as Barry Soetoro. An entry in the journal of the California assembly in reference to grants given to <strong>foreign exchange students</strong> (this official government document lists Obama as a foreigner not a US citizen. A US citizen wouldn\u2019t qualify for foreign exchange student funding) states Obama as Barry Soetoro from Indonesia.</p>\n<p>The first name of a child is always the same from birth. If throughout his childhood Obama went by the first name of Barry then legally his birth name would have to be Barry. In order to register any child for school an official birth certificate must be presented. To receive a government grant proof of citizenship and birth must also be submitted. All of the evidence is stating that Barack Obama\u2019s legal first name is Barry not Barrack.</p>\n<p>A biography of Obama\u2019s Occidental College days states that when Obama was 18-19 he attended school as BARRY SOETORO. And it wasn\u2019t until he met a girl by the name of Regina that Obama started using the name Barack.\u00a0 Regina was the first to start calling him Barack.\u00a0 There seems to be no record of Obama legally changing his first name from Barry to Barack.</p>\n<p>While being sworn in as an attorney in the State of Illinois, Mr Obama had to provide his personal information under oath. He was asked, if he had any other names, he responded none. In reality, he used the name Barry Soetoro in an entry in the journal of the California assembly in reference to grants given to foreign exchange students. Mr. Soetoro/Obama clearly defrauded the State Bar of Illinois and perjured himself while concealing his identity. Anybody else would\u2019ve been disbarred for this and the matter would\u2019ve been forwarded to the district attorney for prosecution for perjury and fraud, however nothing was done to Mr. Obama. More importantly, why did he conceal his identity?</p>\n<p>If Obama didn\u2019t legally have his name changed from Barry to Barack then the birth certificate he passed to Congress is a fake, a forgery.\u00a0 If his name was registered as Barry Soetoro even though Obama claims his real name is Barack Obama then Obama defrauded the state of California in order to receive college funding.\u00a0 Obama knowingly presented a false document to the state wherein he claimed to be a foreign student in order to illegally acquire financial aid.</p>\n<p>U.S. Code</p>\n<p>TITLE 18 &gt; PART I &gt; CHAPTER 47\u2014FRAUD AND FALSE STATEMENTS</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a7\u00a01015.

Obama\u2019s college transcripts from Occidental College indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at the school.\n\nThe transcript from Occidental College shows that Obama (Barry Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship (scholarship) for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program \u2013 an international educational exchange program sponsored by the U.S. government.\n\nGrants are available for U.S. citizens to go abroad and for non-U.S. citizens with no U.S. permanent residence to come to the U.S. To qualify, for the non-US citizen scholarship to study in the U.S., a student applicant must claim and provide proof of foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama\u2019s detractors have been seeking. The United States Constitution requires that Presidents (and Vice Presidents) of the United States be natural born citizens of the United States.\n\n\u201cNo Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\u201d\n\nBarack Hussein Obama. A man with many identities. A \u201cbirth certificate\u201d suddenly appeared from Hawaii dated April 25, 2011. However, there is not a single midwife or doctor in all of Hawaii who remembers helping Ann Stanley to bring Hussein into this world. Reports indicate that Ann Stanley returned to Hawaii about three years after Obama\u2019s birth in Kenya and tried to register his birth as a US birth. In those days a birth did not need to be registered right after birth. A parent had to register a child\u2019s birth within three years.\n\nCertified copy of Registration of Birth from Kenya, dated 17th of February 1964 and signed by Deputy Registrar Joshua Sioon Couya. This is a copy of an original that had been signed by Registrar E.F Lavender on 5th of August in 1961.\n\n\n\nObama hasn\u2019t met and doesn\u2019t meet the basic qualifications for the presidency \u2013 must be natural born citizen.\n\nObama has been named in dozens of civil lawsuits alleging he is not eligible to be president, with many filing a criminal complaint alleging the commander-in-chief is a fraud.\n\nThe filed indictments disputes Obama\u2019s eligibility to be president under the U.S. Constitution which requires that eligible candidates for the United States presidency be \u201cnatural born\u201d citizens.\n\nU.S. soldiers including a general refuse to recognize Obama as their Commander in Chief since he is not a U.S. citizen. The soldiers have challenged Obama\u2019s legitimacy by filing federal lawsuits against Obama.\n\nOn such soldier was U.S. Army Maj. Stefan Frederick Cook who was given orders to deploy to Afghanistan. Cook refused to deploy stating that he shouldn\u2019t have to go because Obama is not a U.S. citizen and therefore not legally President and Commander in Chief. The military revoked the orders with no reason given. Speculation is that Obama would rather not see this thing go to court before a judge!\n\n\u201cIn the 20-page document \u2014 filed with the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia \u2014 the California-based Taitz asks the court to consider granting his client\u2019s request based upon Cook\u2019s belief that Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the United States and is therefore ineligible to serve as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces,\u201d the Ledger-Enquirer reported.\n\nCook \u201cwould be acting in violation of international law by engaging in military actions outside the United States under this President\u2019s command. \u2026 simultaneously subjecting himself to possible prosecution as a war criminal by the faithful execution of these duties,\u201d Taitz stated.\n\nObama says he was born in Hawaii in 1961, just two years after it became a state.\n\nThere are many lawsuits and claims that Barack Obama was never eligible to be president because he wasn\u2019t born in the United States. And there is credible evidence that suggests he is not legally eligible to serve as President of the United States.\n\n\n\nNewspaper print of LA Times \u2013 Occidental recalls \u2018Barry\u2019 Obama. [Click on image to link to Los Angeles Times article, January 29, 2007]\n\nObama\u2019s Literary Agent\u2019s Edward Acton and Jane Dystel in 1991.\n\nObama\u2019s Literary Agent in 1991 promoting his book \u2018Journeys in Black and White\u2018 describing Obama as, \u201cborn in Kenya, and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii\u2019. How would Miriam Goderich come up with a \u2018mistake\u2019 like that unless she was told by Obama himself that he was born in Kenya, which is confirmed by the birth certificate and the school records from Indonesia.\n\n\n\nNumerous official government documents records Obama being legally registered as Barry Soetoro. School registries shows the registration of Barack Obama under the name Barry Soetoro. During his Occidental College days he is registered as Barry Soetoro. An entry in the journal of the California assembly in reference to grants given to foreign exchange students (this official government document lists Obama as a foreigner not a US citizen. A US citizen wouldn\u2019t qualify for foreign exchange student funding) states Obama as Barry Soetoro from Indonesia.\n\nThe first name of a child is always the same from birth. If throughout his childhood Obama went by the first name of Barry then legally his birth name would have to be Barry. In order to register any child for school an official birth certificate must be presented. To receive a government grant proof of citizenship and birth must also be submitted. All of the evidence is stating that Barack Obama\u2019s legal first name is Barry not Barrack.\n\nA biography of Obama\u2019s Occidental College days states that when Obama was 18-19 he attended school as BARRY SOETORO. And it wasn\u2019t until he met a girl by the name of Regina that Obama started using the name Barack. Regina was the first to start calling him Barack. There seems to be no record of Obama legally changing his first name from Barry to Barack.\n\nWhile being sworn in as an attorney in the State of Illinois, Mr Obama had to provide his personal information under oath. He was asked, if he had any other names, he responded none. In reality, he used the name Barry Soetoro in an entry in the journal of the California assembly in reference to grants given to foreign exchange students. Mr. Soetoro/Obama clearly defrauded the State Bar of Illinois and perjured himself while concealing his identity. Anybody else would\u2019ve been disbarred for this and the matter would\u2019ve been forwarded to the district attorney for prosecution for perjury and fraud, however nothing was done to Mr. Obama. More importantly, why did he conceal his identity?\n\nIf Obama didn\u2019t legally have his name changed from Barry to Barack then the birth certificate he passed to Congress is a fake, a forgery. If his name was registered as Barry Soetoro even though Obama claims his real name is Barack Obama then Obama defrauded the state of California in order to receive college funding. Obama knowingly presented a false document to the state wherein he claimed to be a foreign student in order to illegally acquire financial aid.\n\nU.S. Code\n\nTITLE 18 > PART I > CHAPTER 47\u2014FRAUD AND FALSE STATEMENTS\n\n\u00a7 1015. Naturalization, citizenship or alien registry\n\n(a) Whoever knowingly makes any false statement under oath, in any case, proceeding, or matter relating to, or under, or by virtue of any law of the United States relating to naturalization, citizenship, or registry of aliens; or\n\n(b) Whoever knowingly, with intent to avoid any duty or liability imposed or required by law, denies that he has been naturalized or admitted to be a citizen, after having been so naturalized or admitted; or\n\n(c) Whoever uses or attempts to use any certificate of arrival, declaration of intention, certificate of naturalization, certificate of citizenship or other documentary evidence of naturalization or of citizenship, or any duplicate or copy thereof, knowing the same to have been procured by fraud or false evidence or without required appearance or hearing of the applicant in court or otherwise unlawfully obtained; or\n\n(d) Whoever knowingly makes any false certificate, acknowledgment or statement concerning the appearance before him or the taking of an oath or affirmation or the signature, attestation or execution by any person with respect to any application, declaration, petition, affidavit, deposition, certificate of naturalization, certificate of citizenship or other paper or writing required or authorized by the laws relating to immigration, naturalization, citizenship, or registry of aliens; or\n\n(e) Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or claim that he is, or at any time has been, a citizen or national of the United States, with the intent to obtain on behalf of himself, or any other person, any Federal or State benefit or service, or to engage unlawfully in employment in the United States; or\n\n(f) Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or claim that he is a citizen of the United States in order to register to vote or to vote in any Federal, State, or local election (including an initiative, recall, or referendum)\u2014\n\nThis evidence is sufficient to annul the presidency of Obama. Official Occidental College transcripts registered with the state declares that Obama is an impostor.\n\nSOURCE", "images": ["http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/hillaryscandal-compressed-100x100.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/themes/viral/images/shadow.png", "https://i1.wp.com/www.truthorfiction.com/images/obamacertificate2011.jpg", "https://themuslimissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/obama-1991-author-profile-barack-obama.jpg?w=610", "https://themuslimissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/94ee8-obama_lat_012907.jpg?w=566&h=426", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/obama-facepalm-150x150.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.deflationeconomy.com/images/soetoro2.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-cropped-usalojko-2-1.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-12-at-7-compressed-100x100.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/i613.photobucket.com/albums/tt216/LogicWings/mombasa_copy.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/transcript-compressed.jpg", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Trump-Just-PISSED-OFF-Richest-Man-In-America-With-PERFECT-Kick-In-The-Ass-100x100.jpg", "https://themuslimissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/obama-literary-agents.png?w=610", "http://usapoliticsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ObamaBirthCertSR-compressed-100x100.jpg"], "videos": []}
